110,7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,Isabella B.,12/9/2017,rKvPQZcgjrQOLRU0phPoAQ,Queen of Tarts,"  Queen of Tarts   a popular breakfast place amongst foodies, locals    ur ts. So many people   pointed me   th  place:  's long considered among one of     st Restaurants by McKennas' Guides (local ratings),  's recommended as one of   cheap eats by Rick Steves (Europe guru),   has solid ratings on Yelp   TripAdv or (#, over  reviews)     hotel front desk staff highly recommend  . If multiple sources of different types recommend a restaurant,   know that   got  rself a winner.

 re   actually two Queen of Tarts, but both   s uated right next   each o r.   smaller of   two overlooks   busy Dame Street while   o r one lies near   entrance   an alley. Both lie right on   edge of Temple Bar   close   Chr t Church Ca dral.   helped that th  place was less than a  minute walk from my hotel so I wouldn't   stuck w h hotel breakfast all   time.

  one overlooking Dame Street really   qu e small. Tables look as if  y   a tight squeeze but     relatively cozy. I had breakfast here twice   first as a way     fuel after a  hour flight from   US,   o r   try out a trad ional Ir h breakfast.

My first s p I didn't want   eat  o heartily as   plane fed me well so I just ate   first thing that caught my eye   a chocolate scone (~€). Had     w h a mocha (€.). Scone was served w h Ir h butter   jam. I thought I would need clotted cream for my scone but due     Ir h butter   chocolate chips turns out I didn't need any more cream. Went well w h my smooth mocha.

On my second v   I got  ir hearty breakfast (bacon, pork & leek sausage, fried egg, pota  chive cake, roast  ma , rel h &  ast, €.). Th     ir interpretation of an Ir h fry up. Keep in mind that   bacon served in Europe   akin   a fried ham   NOT taken from   pork  lly (what makes American bacon a noteworthy breakfast  em). Was a ra r average breakfast but sat fied  s purpose     a filling breakfast for a day's worth of walking. Eggs   cooked over easy. Sausage   of medium thickness. Pota  chive cake was very bl    needed salt   hot sauce   make    tter. I did like   Ir h soda bread served on   side.

Queen of Tarts has  s place on a foodie  ur of Dublin. While I won't come back here for  ir full breakfasts I'll certainly come back   try  ir scones, pastries   cakes as th     ir specialty.  y     cute br ed  ems   take away as souvenirs if     a foodie friend in  r life     want      m a unique souvenir."

I've heard about   Queen of Tarts for years   finally got around   going  re on th  trip home.  y   two branches, very close   each o r (Cow's Lane   on Dame Street at Cork Hill). I didn't stay ( re were no seats available anyway)   just picked up a single tart   go:  ir chocolate pear   almond tart. Bot m line was that   was a nice tart but not amazing   perhaps my expectations were  o high.   combination of chocolate   almond was good,     pear on  s own was tasty but didn't combine w h   chocolate so well; a simpler combination of pear almond or chocolate almond might    tter. I felt like  y overdid   w h   flavors     speaking of overdoing  ,   pastry was a l tle overdone.   tart was €.,   although that's not a high price by some st ards, I had two tarts in   same week that were at least as good   cost €. or less (e.g., Heaven's Cakes in   Engl h Market in Cork). Still, staff mem rs were friendly     Queen of Tarts   still a nice place   v   if  're in    a.

I'm   giving  m / ""green stars"" for social   environmental impact. Here   some pros   cons:
Pro:
Everything   baked fresh on s e.
 're supporting an independent, woman owned business.
As far as I know,  y use free range eggs.
Some food suppliers (K h F h, Odlums flour)   local   value sustainabil y.
Cons:
 ir chocolate supplier, Callebaut (  world's largest maker of chocolate, largely serving   food industry) has a mediocre record on sustainabil y   labor  sues   only % of Callebaut's cocoa  ans   from sustainable sources.
 ir coffee (Lavazza)   tea (Barry's   Twinings) suppliers      low average in terms of labor  sues, transp ncy,   sustainabil y.
  boxes used for  ir pastries   cardboard (good) but contain a plastic window (bad)     would    tter   use a cellophane window so that   can   recycled or composted (or no window at all).
  good thing   that  se cons can easily   fixed should   owners w h   do so.

Salad was dressed but had no flavor,     lettuce was somewhat wilted.

S wich was spicy au rgine, haloumi cheese,   rocket lettuce. I had v ions of slices of eggplant/au rgine grilled w h spices. Wrong.   was cut in  small pieces w h a  ma  sauce, no d cernible spice. Bread was nothing special   part was  o hard   dry   eat, unless one   starving.

I chose      ir fr tata   wow! Mind blown!   was amazing! Packed w h so much flavour! I really couldn't recommend   more if   go here.

After my girlfriend had fin hed her soup (seriously... Soup) we decided   sh  a very chocolaty pecan pie tart slice   again, wow! So tasty! Not sickeningly sweet, just enough.   was almost like having a brownie/pecan tart.

Now   wonder why after loving   food I only give three stars? Service.   service really was shocking. Once we had  en seated we were passed over   over again  fore  ing approached   take our order. Once   order was taken, our lunch came... Well mine did. I was almost fin hed when finally my girlfriends arrived.   was soup... How can   take so long!? Once all done, we again were ignored.

When we got  re,   staff were clearly very busy   rushed everywhere, but  y were all very pol e   helpful    y reserved a place for me   my  friends (who only showed up  minutes after me)...  we were s ting upstairs under   lampshade.   was very cozy   warm (but not  o hot).

I will     knock a star (  probably a half) off for   fact that I was d appointed w h what we ordered.  tween    of us, we got a round of coffee's, a hot chocolate, baileys choco chip cheesecake, apple    rry crumble,   choco pecan pie.  coffees were fine,   hot chocolate was not chocolaty enough   very ""meh"",   choco pecan pie was   lacking in a good strong chocolate flavor     bailey cheesecake had no taste of Baiiley's at all   was  tally bl .

People will over rate th  place  cause of   many interesting options  y  , but each individual treat   just not well made enough. If   look up a recipe for most of   cakes   pies on offer,   might do a  tter job.

For seven euros fifty I was expecting something smashing. But what I received was probably worth around four euros fifty.   filling was nice, but nice really  n't good enough for   amount of money  're paying.   s wich was add ionally let down by   bread.   was supposed     granary bread, but   was similar     sliced brown bread pan.

On a whirlwind  week vacation   Irel ,   girlfriend & I tried   see & experience absolutely as much of th  incredible l  as we could. We did not accompl h every last activ y we w hed we could   on our ra r amb ious  inerary. None less, we did d cover a l  of numerous stunning & magical wonders. We did see a l  of unending natural  auty. We did learn of a l  w h a monumentally long h  ry of trials, tragedies & triumphs. We did     meet many kind, humorous, warm & generous people. Our vacation   Irel  was just  weeks, but that was time enough   know th    a l  easy   love & a l      sorely m sed.

From our st stint in Dublin,   girlfriend & I had heard glowing recommendations for Queen of Tarts qu e a few times.  re seemed     a consensus that th  was   place        st sweets/ desserts in  wn. Back in  wn & wrapping up our own walking  ur of Dublin on our last day in Irel , we made sure   s p by   try some of   highly acclaimed goodies.

Expectations were very high. Queen of Tarts   a cute l tle shop. Service was courteous & inv ing. A bounty of treats were on d play & everything looked temptingly delicious. After much contemplation,   girlfriend chose   Vic ria Spongecake & I got   Chocolate Fudge Cake.

Even w h   bar ra ed very high, Queen of Tarts surpassed   mark w h  of  s cakes, but fell just a l tle short on   o r.   Vic ria Spongecake was light & mo t sweet sublime perfection.   my taste, however,   Chocolate Fudge Cake wasn't qu e packing enough chocolate fudge richness.   was still really good, but not up     level of   Vic ria Spongecake.

W h our sweet  oths sated,   girlfriend & I could board our plane   home   next morning assured that we did not m s   sugary decadence of Queen of Tarts.   soo  a seriously sweet  oth in Dublin, go   Queen of Tarts looking for   absolute very  st of sweets/ desserts & may , just may , find  ."

A live piano player serenaded   cus mers w h h  take on well known songs. Great ambience!

We walked upstairs   I loved   Countess Markievicz quote painted on   wall on       Mezzanine.   loved   busts of    signa ries. Don't lose that republican aspect    's something     proud of that a lot of places   people unfortunately don't take interest or pride in.

We were served by a lovely wa ress called Nabi, from  aly. She was attentive, fast   actually spoke   us conversationally, ra r than just robotically taking our order   having done w h us. She was busy up  re, mainly on her own, but that didn't affect service. On s ting down, cold ice water   lemon   given    .  's always welcome, so why do places wa  for     ask for  ?

  starters were fantastic   had us really exc ed for   mains. We had Carlingford mussels, seafood chowder     goats cheese tartlet   sh   tween   four of us. Exqu  e! All cooked   perfection.

We   ordered a bottle of French red wine (Camessac)     was one of    st I've had,   date! Although I am only  so I'll test that throughout   years! ;)

We each ordered a lamb shank for mains    y were delicious.   champ   gravy was   so tasty.  re was a lot of meat on   shank  o!

Myself   my partner explained that were  ge r for  years   Nabi. She congratulated us warmly   enthusiastically. We're a gay couple     was heartwarming for us!

We couldn't manage desserts so we didn't order any, but   our surpr e, a complimentary dessert came   our table w h 'congratulations' on  ! Such a kind  uch!   o r surpr e was that   bill was extremely reasonable for   qual y   service.

).  Great drinks.  First off,  re   a good selection of  ers on tap (  was especially nice   see O'Hara's s ut  I mean, Dublin   Dublin, but  re's only so much Guinness I could drink in one trip), w h a few examples of each major style.   re were qu e a few people enjoying all manner of cocktails (ranging from   classic     exotic),   wine as well.  I think each draft  er was about . euros, very reasonable for an average bar   surpr ingly inexpensive for a nice place like   Bank.

).  Great service.  We sat at   bar,   found   bartenders     attentive, cheerful,   just generally great.  

).  Great atmosphere.    interior of   Bank    autiful.  Even  tter, people weren't crammed in like   might find at o r places    was clearly full (we sat at   bar  cause  re would    en a wa  for a table), but bustling in a pleasant way, ra r than making cus mers feel cramped.  Clearly,   Bank   a ""fancy restaurant first, fancy bar second,"" which made   a very comfortable place   settle in for dinner   drinks.

).  Great food.  We went all out on   food,   got   ""Trio of Ir h Spring Lamb.""    was a great value at  euros for   platter,     included a giant shepherd's pie, lamb shanks for each,   plenty of lamb filet, along w h a side of ve ables   a generous portion of pota es au gratin, all cooked   seasoned   absolute perfection.    don't even   me started on   gravy...at   end, I was practically drinking  , unwilling   let even a drop go   waste.  Don't bo r w h  ting appetizers,  cause  's a huge amount of food,   I almost can't imagine choosing anything else (though I am certain that   rest of   menu   just as delicious).

). Great value.  We couldn't  lieve how great   was, especially at that price  honestly, going out for a fancy meal   usually much more expensive,   I think our  tal was about  euros (  lamb platter   four or five draft  ers).

Next time we're in Dublin, I'm going   push hard   come back,  cause   was honestly one of    st meals I've had in recent memory.  /, no question."

  food was excellent!

My friend ordered fresh oysters which said were amazing as  's not easy   find a restaurant that serves good oysters in Dublin,     cheese soup which she   liked. I thought that   presentation, qual y   taste of   food was very high yet   prices were very reasonable.

So I turn   look for someone that worked  re     just so happened that   bartender that had served us our drinks was walking by so I asked him if he could send someone over   take our order.  He s pped right  re, smiled   said, ""Sure, what would   like?""    so we placed our order w h him.

  may seem like a small thing, but I've eaten in a lot of restaurants in my life   generally when   ask someone who   not  r server   take  r order,  y say, ""Sure, I'll    r server right over"".  But   fact that th   ng gentlemen simply s pped whatever he was already doing    ok our order immediately was fantastic   exemplifies   highest level of service, in my view.  In fact, I can't remem r th  happening   me  fore.

At   end of   meal, just after leaving, I realized I didn't   my backpack   thought I had left   under   table.  After searching frantically w h   help of one of   wa  staff, a manager came over   talk   me.  I was upset   was  ting heated as if   was   manager's fault.  He h led   s uation w h incredible patience    ok my contact information.  Calming me down a b    returning me   san y.  

I retraced my steps   found   backpack at   previous place we had v  ed, thankfully.  However   Bank manager phoned me   texted me that he had checked   secur y video   found   section of   video where me   my friend had come in   door   could verify that I did not     backpack w h me when I arrived.  He  ok   time   do th  during   busiest part of a busy evening.  I was v  ing Dublin for work from   states     was incredibly stressful   me that I had potentially lost th  backpack that not only had expensive  ems in   but had sentimental value.    manager empathized w h my s uation   went   extra mile.  Again, ano r great service experience.

Walking in,   realize where ""  Bank"" name came from   th  used     a gr  bank in   heart of Dublin.     ornately decorated w h classy art   mouldings everywhere,    re   even a replica of   Book of Kells next     entryway (which   can actually take a picture of, unlike   real one!)

  food   service   fantastic,  o.   would've  tally gotten five stars except that I ordered   Eggs Florentine (  ve arian version of Eggs  nedict)   at first  y gave me an actual eggs  nedict. Once I pointed th  out, however,  y were very gracious     didn't take  o long   correct   m take     chef himself actually brought     me   apologized, so I really appreciated that.

My favor e part of   Bank, however, was   live piano music.   musical  me that day was soundtracks, both cinema    atre,   we had   most fun time guessing which super familiar sounding movie or show each song was from. (""OOH Lord of   Rings! ... Defin ely Le M  ... AHH I love that movie but I what was   name?!"") Long after we'd fin hed eating, my friend Matt had   practically  g us   finally leave so we could continue exploring Dublin.

720,6MizZ9yqvVMfnlgpbaVeVw,Alex S.,25/8/2015,dlClCiMV4Y8yTc9vCUCABw,The Bank on College Green,"Let's just cut right     chase: my v       Bank has easily jumped in  my  p  favor e dining experiences ever. Even if   just walked in, ordered nothing, used   bathroom   left,  re   a very real chance   would leave w h  r jaw dropped,  r curios y piqued    r phone snapping a few pho s   post on  r social network of choice.  cause while   Bank   a place   see     seen at,     doubles as a genuinely one of a kind place   grab a b e   eat   a  er, backed w h some of   absolute  st service in   c y.

  was our final night in Irel    we wanted   conclude   trip w h a v     a place we could not see back in   U.S., while   eating great food, downing great drinks   possibly  ting some great pho s that would not   us arrested. I'm proud   say   Bank provided all of th ,   more!

We made reservations for Friday night on   Thursday prior,   all that was available was :. Figuring we had nothing   lose, we stuck w h :   got  re   next night at :   hang out at   bar.   right away    came obvious why   earliest reservation was only open at :.   place was absolutely packed w h guests of all walks of life: college students, women celebrating a girls' night out, businessmen, people who make drinking  ir full time c er, etc.  re seemed     two hostesses running (l erally, at times) around   floor, fielding guests arriving   taking  m    ir seats,    y made   chaos around  m look inv ing   fun. Granted, th  may      en  cause we were all pages deep in    bar menu by th  point, but   atmosphere here was absolutely kinetic.

Speaking of   atmosphere, perhaps    st part of   Bank     decor.   Bank was, surpr e, surpr e, an actual bank from   turn of   th century.   ceiling   gorgeous   stretches forever,   columns flanking   seating  a   impressive,     bathrooms downstairs allow     give new meaning   ""making a depos "" since  y   built in    old vault.   if   make a reservation for a table,       go upstairs   a private bar   dining room   look out over   all.

 re   nine tables upstairs,    y go fast. When we were seated,  re was only one o r table seated.   four of us were quickly joined by o r parties   all nine tables were soon occupied.   I lied:    st part of our v   here was our server, Nadia. She, along w h her partners upstairs, made our v   absolutely priceless. She was easygoing, attentive, quick w h service,   absolutely hilarious. I almost never say that about anyone, but she had   four of us busting a gut quicker than   could say ""Wa , how many drinks did   pound?"" My sincerest compliments   Nadia     rest of   staff at   Bank for ensuring our time here was unrivaled.

I guess I should mention   food, huh? In short,   was all phenomenal. From   seafood chowder,   cauliflower   zucchini soup, through   f h   chips, pork  lly, pork chops   seafood linguini,  fore ending w h a fulfilling rhubarb,   entire meal kept  ting impossibly  tter    tter. I kept downing Detro  martin   fore fin hing w h an order of Wr er's Tears (strictly based on name alone)   I would still    re doing   same if I did not   a plane   catch in six hours. Or if   staff did not forcibly remove me for taking up space, whichever came first.

When all   said   done, I prom e  r v       Bank will   a memorable one.   staff   all wonderful,   menu   varied   delicious,   atmosphere   eye catching     memories here will last a lifetime. Not bad for a place where   can go     bathroom in an ab oned vault."

One needn't step much fur r than   threshold   w ness   opulence that formerly characterized Dublin, ""  second c y of   Empire.""  I happened   come here for a pint during   holiday season (after Chr tmas but  fore New Year's),   nearly bru ed my jaw from   h ting   floor.  Red marble walls, pillars,   columns, wh e marble reliefs, busts of influential figures from Ir h h  ry,   a tastefully incorporated mezzanine really make th  a special place    .

  brews cater   a broad palate.  I tried   Galway Hooker, which   both fru y   creamy at   same time, making   hard for me   classify (but ultimately w hin ale terr ory).  Of course  y know how   pour a nice, creamy Guinness.

If   look      p of    l  in   bar (not   mezzanine,    l  w h all   bottles of yummy yummy alcohol),  'll find what I'm convinced     world's largest Martini glass   Champagne flute.   re     a ra r sizable Cognac snifter    er goblet.

I highly recommend th  place for early drinks ( ), for   holiday v  or who's in    a   wants   see something  autiful w hout sacrificing  er time,   for people who can manage   grab a table."

Okay, so now that I am officially longing for Dublin, here     details.

  first time we went here, we weren't entirely sure what we were walking in , but I knew   would   expensive,   I was pretty sure I was underdressed in my Dublin sightseeing clo s. That said, we were greeted warmly,   seated in   balcony seating  a overlooking   rest of   restaurant. Our server that day was wonderful. She was super nice   helpful. We decided   stray from our Guinness   each got a cocktail,  cause   l t was so very tempting.  y were good.  n we each got an appetizer. I will never, ever for    delicious l tle cheese souffle.   was heavenly.  n we each got a steak for our dinner. Both were delicious...

Tangent... three particularly wonderful things I noticed as an American in Irel :
.) ""Locally sourced""   a big buzz term in America.   doesn't seem      re.   reason   that EVERYTHING   locally sourced. Menus even l t where  y    ir  ef,   I was never d appointed by    ef.
.)   pota    NEVER an afterthought. Here, we think, ""oh we need a side... should I do fries or chips?""  re,  y bake a few pota es   a roasted golden perfection,  n scallop some on   side,  n provide   w h   mashed pota es, which don't feature   sour cream or garlic,  y feature   POTA . So good....
.) Salt   a seasoning, not a flavor. Th    what I m s   most about Irel , even more so than all   Guiness,   pota es,   culture,     scenery. When     gravy in Irel ,     packed full of flavor   Not salt. When     a stew or soup,   tastes like well seasoned meat   ve ables   NOT salt. Coming back, things   soooo overseasoned. I m s  , Irel .

Anyway, forgive my pining. So   steak dinners, both were amazing  well seasoned, well cooked,  autifully presented on wooden slabs   surrounded by ve ables that were shown an equal amount of attention in seasoning, cooking,   presentation. We made   through all of that food somehow,   would   probably gone back     hotel   lay down for   rest of   day; however, that wonderful wa ress   happened     a wonderful saleswoman,   all she had   do was tell us what   desserts were. I ordered a Baileys   coffee. I do not know how  y managed   turn what I generally consider     a two ingredient, simple drink in  such a masterpiece, but   drink came out w h an inch of lightly whipped   lightly sweetened cream on  p, sprinkled w h a sugary cocoa   tasting like something out of a dream.  y   gave me two l tle chocolate coins on   side. Yay!  n came   dessert. I don't remem r what   was called, but     what a molten chocolate cake dreams of  ing.   l tle puck shaped wonder came out on a plate w h a jar of black cherries that had  en preserved or macerated or lightly pickled or SOMEthing (point    y were tart, sweet, housemade,   delicious).  re was freshly whipped cream in   lid of   jar,     was served w h a fresh straw rry.  n   was all dusted w h a  uch of powdered sugar.   l tle chocolate cake was dark chocolate, fudgy perfection, that had a liquid core of chocolate.   was paired  autifully w h   fru s   I got   again   second time we went in. (Ahem, please excuse my drool.)

Ambiance was great.   place  self was a bank that has  en converted in  a lovely dining  a.  re   a balcony that overlooks   rest of   place.   doesn't   much seating since   covers only a fraction of   squ  footage, but if     lucky enough     a seat up  re,   can overlook   massive bar in   center of   main dining  a     piano platform, which had   same gentleman playing  re both v  s. He was brilliant,   was able   seamlessly trans ion from a classical piece in  a current Adele h    back out   Eric Clap n, all w h h  own spin.   was at a good volume that allowed everyone   ei r l ten in, or just enjoy   music as a pleasant backdrop   a sociable meal.   ceilings, walls,   floors   all covered in adornments that may just interrupt  r conversation, as  re   so very much detail for  r viewing pleasure.

  menu changes seasonally, so much of what I   descri d here may   gone, but  re was nothing that we had (or that anyone around us had) that didn't look amazing or that didn't seem   warrant rave reviews.   staff in general was very pleasant."

We stuck   a pint of Guinness which was good. Service   very professional   efficient. Bathroom was a b  messy. Some people   an aversion   putting paper in bins, I'm sure  ir argument     unexpected bathroom gusts due     pressure bars in   North.

  interior   very impressive. Like   interior of   T anic but on l    sans a glacier. On Sunday  re was girl playing   singing tunes on   gr  piano, popular h s but in a Fiona Apple style   very talented.

BUT, after  ing flat out ignored for far  o long in that particular restaurant (which shall remain nameless), my husb  suggested that we go     Bank,   a drink,   regroup.  st. suggestion. EVER.

As we were walking in, some r om smoker outside  ld us we had made a good choice,   that ""  food   really good here!"" We weren't planning on eating, so we snagged   last two places at   bar   had a look at   drinks l t.   bartenders were quick   friendly,   we had our drinks in front of us in no time. So, I started looking around.   Bank   gorgeous! No,  's not a trad ional Ir h pub,  's l erally an old bank, from   time when banks were  autiful, classy inst utions. Th    old school Vic rian Dublin at  s finest. Like Annie L. said,   was like  ing at a bar in   T anic or something.  ns of marble, wood,   a lovely stained glass ceiling, large pillars, statues...  was amazing. Never mind   fact that   whole place was still decorated for   holidays, adding that l tle extra b  of sparkle   holiday cheer,    re was a live pian t playing.   was awesome. I was sold.

We asked   see a menu,   saw plenty of options that appealed   us, so we decided that we'd try   snag a table   eat  re after all. As   was fairly busy, I was on table duty,   grab d   first one that came empty on   o r side of   bar. Our server appe d quickly,   was happy   refill our drinks while we decided on our dinner options.

My husb  started w h   seafood chowder,   I had   pear   blue cheese salad. I didn't realize Cashel Blue Cheese was so mild, but   was great in   salad   all of   flavors really complimented each o r w hout  ing overpowering. My husb  enjoyed h  chowder,   I LOVED   Guinness   treacle soda bread that came w h     that stuff was amazing. Plus, he got about  slices, so he was happy   sh .

For mains, my husb  had   steak s wich,   he was happy   report that   steak was cooked correctly (r ). I had   seafood linguine, which was full of seafood,   overall very good, but just a b  bl . But w h that much seafood, I didn't really c  about   noodles,   didn't actually fin h  m.

We were  o full for dessert, though I did   an espresso, which was a nice way   end a good meal. I   did v     downstairs ladies room  fore we left, as my husb  said   downstairs restrooms were pretty cool. He was right    re   vaults   antique safes down  re,     was defin ely one of   more interesting bathrooms that I   v  ed!

Blonde Lady who plated our food  ok forever   do so,  n passed said plates   a Brunette Lady at a till. So, we had   queue   order,  n queue again at a till   pay whilst our food sat on plates going cold. When we did eventually       till, Brunette  ok forever   provide us w h coffee    ast. We had   st  wa ing for ages as she  asted bread   got coffees/teas.   was ridiculous. I was so fed up wa ing I  ld her I didn't want any  ast but she didn't seem   underst  th    kept asking which type of bread I wanted  asted, as app ntly   was part of   cooked breakfast deal. She   didn't     concept that we were all paying individually for our meals. Eventually   thankfully, we escaped her   got a table easily.  re weren't many people  re   we had probably m sed   breakfast rush.

Our two cooked breakfasts   porridge had  en obtained already, but   pancakes had yet     made   we were  ld  y would   left   our table. Fifteen minutes passed   three of us had very nearly fin hed our food   still no pancakes. We s pped a guy who was clearing tables   ask about   pancakes, he went   enquire    ld  y would   left down ASAP.

A fur r  minutes passed,  n Brunette shuffled out w h pancakes in h    gave  m   ano r table!

We really should just   asked for our money back   left, but of course our dining companion was hungry   he wanted food, thus we wa ed on those pancakes   for a long, long time.

Over   last few years  y've improved   exp ed, w h nice seating upstairs   a more efficient counter space so   process of lining up, ordering food   finding a seat   now easy peasy!

I had   Health Special (€.) that's advert ed outside.   was an amazing meal   I thoroughly recommend     not just for   health  nef s but    cause  's a great way   sample  ir amazing food. For  Euro     a small soup (actually fairly big), salad greens plus  r choice of two o r salads, raw crackers (or bread if   prefer), vegan pâté,   a glass of green juice. For soup, I chose   sweet pota , butter an   roast garlic     was most delicious. Salad # was garlic pota es w h roast hazelnuts in vegan mayonna e   th  was truly amazing.   looks just like an everyday pota  salad but   was    st I've ever had!   hazelnuts   vegan mayo really elevated  . Salad # was baked  fu, rice, arame,   scallion dressed in mirin   tamari   th  was as good as or even  tter than   pota  salad!   green juice was refreshing   light; nicely decorated w h a sprig of celery. A great way   de x after a few nights out in Dublin. Having said that I did  p off   meal w h a glass of wine! (An organic  alian Montepulciano d'Abruzzo for €. that turned out     good  .)

I'm giving  m / ""green stars"" for social   environmental impact. Kudos of course for  ing such a longst ing ve arian restaurant, demonstrating   countless people over  years that meat  n't necessary for an enjoyable meal.  y use local   organic suppliers for fru    veggies whenever possible,    ir dry goods ( ans, rice, lentils, etc.)     organic.  y use Fair Trade coffees   teas, organic milk,   free range eggs for all cooking   baking.

 y don't generate a lot of waste   recycle   compost   major y of whatever   generated.  y re use plastic containers wherever possible   encourage cus mers   bring in  ir own take away containers. If   take food away but don't bring a container,  y provide recyclable or biodegradable containers   biodegradable forks   knives. My only complaint was that  ir pate was served in l tle plastic containers even though we were eating in house, although  y   at least recyclable.  ir electric y   wind generated, provided by Airtric y    y use natural gas for all cooking.  y     a bike   work scheme for employees.

I v  ed a second time   just had tea   an oat bar w h some red fru s     was   absolutely divine, again hard   pick just one from  ir selection, I could   had one of each!

A ve arian restaurant,   serving vegan, yeast free, dairy free, gluten free   wheat free f ,   has long  en   mainstay of Dubs in search of a 'meat   two veg' alternative. Cornucopia has  en serving up hearty, nutty, leafy delights since , long  fore most people  gan   wonder whe r eating  o much meat, from  o far away, stuffed w h  o many chemicals was such a good thing after all!

Don't worry,   don't       a devoted veggie   enjoy   menu. I can thoroughly recommend   salads   full of a variety of  ans, nuts   seeds accompanied by roast ve ables, herbs   spices,   tangy dressings. Main courses, such as   spinach   hazelnut cannelloni,   generally warming, flavoursome   filling. In my experience,   d hes   genuinely sat fied both ve arians   (often sceptical) meat eaters alike     th    surely high pra e indeed for meat free cu ine!

At lunchtime   restaurant will inev ably   bustling w h students, shoppers    ers pouring in from   surrounding c y centre.

A quick glimpse on   webs e shows that  re   plans for expansion soon (so at least one builder in Irel  will   kept busy for a while...)

For a main course (including two salads)   a drink,   won't   away w h paying less than €. Some may find th  a b  steep for a quick lunch but      reasonable enough for an early dinner (closing time   at  during   week,  on Saturdays    on Sundays)."

1096,zsmvoEMtKkcbR3wXZRqBfA,Maire B.,27/4/2011,ZdZNRZ1OdQ1MYfaK0vsbNw,Cornucopia,"  know I want   like Cornucopia, but I recently reminded myself why I  n't  en  re in  years. For some reason I find   food combinations awful. As a person w h various food allergies I like   idea of a place that caters   specific types of eaters, but whatever     that goes on here I just don't like   taste of   food. May   s just that me     chef   an entirely different palate, but  euro for a plate of pasta I didn't eat really was not worth  .     doesn't help that   food   luke warm.

  service counter   nonsensical,   bottle neck means that one person (or in my case   two indec ive girls in front of me) can hold up everyone so that all   staff can do   smile awkwardly while   wa  for  m   move on  fore   can   close enough   order.       just me or     chalkboard menu confusingly d ordered? What comes w h salad   what doesn't? what counts as a main   what counts as a salad? What do I want? why   we here? If a tree falls in   woods   no one   around   hear  , does   make a sound?

As a person who has difficulty making a dec ion when given  minutes alone w h a wr ten menu, chalkboards   a nightm . I panic    n order whatever looks vaguely recogn able, which in   case of cornucopia   almost nothing.  's a couple of trays of saucy mush... th    probably why I ended up ordering pasta w h a side of pota es    cause I know what  se things  !! Just as well I got   pota es  cause that was mainly what I ate. I was hungry when I got home :(

May  th    all just a horrible catch  s uation caused by   lack of menus.. may  if  y had wr ten menus I would actually order something I liked     a  tter experience. Table service would   remove   angry impatience, followed by panic, followed by hypocr ical di ring, followed by panic, that I experienced at   counter. Or may    would not help at all,  cause me   chef cornucopia just don't like   same food.

Or may  I'm just b ter  cause  y ran out of cake."

I went   Cornucopia for   first time last night,     was absolutely delightful. I went in around :,   s od in a long h line of people.  re was no real organization   th ,     wasn't clear what exactly what was included in   meals. As someone who likes   know what I am actually paying for,   was a b  of an annoyance. I do appreciate   fact that  ir menu   fresh   changes regularly.  

As for   food   I ate my squash/snow pea/ginger/lemongrass/brown rice d h so quickly, I didn't   time   take a picture. My main came w h  salads      y had at least  options so   was pretty hard   decide which ones   wanted since  y all sounded really good. My main was stellar, but my two sides (chick pea, tabouleh) were not as flavorful as I had hoped!

  canteen style ordering   big seating space was a nice change of pace   ideal for someone who was on   move!   got  r food right away, unless  y were making a fresh batch in   back. Even  n,   wa  was minimal. I'll defin ely   back     sure   take pics next time!"

When I got     counter I couldn't decide, everything looked so great   fresh   creative!  I chose a  fu   spinach casserole    n for my side d hes I got a leafy salad   chickpea salad that I can't qu  remem r what else was in   but   was all so great!    food was really nice,   I decided     a   cookbook   bring back home! (When I bought   I had   choice of a complementary wine or dessert, so I tried a vanilla yogurt cake sort of thing that was pretty good, but I've had  tter desserts).

  was a l tle crowded as   was lunch, but everyone was really super friendly     was warm inside on a cold rainy day.

As usual   re was a good crowd but still was able     a seat in   no problem.  I ordered   Carrot    ma    Tarragon Soup which was gorgeous, as Annie has pointed out in her review, many places overload on salt but th  was tasty     could fell   goodness coming from  .

  unfortunate negative was that all three of us came away w h pretty bl  d hes. My spicy root ve able stew didn't   any spice     at all.   Caesar salad had an original mustard dressing, although a garlic pota  salad showed no evidence of any garlic.

yes  're probably thinking ""why doesn't m s complainy pants just look at   menu?"" but again,  's mostly obscured from view.  's   mostly impossible   figure out what flavor something called ""sprout salad"" has or what   might   drenched in w hout ei r seeing   or  ting some fur r information.

  food (if   can find a table   eat at)   usually on   heavy side. Barley, lentils   pota es seem     in nearly everything,   portion sizes     very large.  st   arrive hungry, but if   ask,   staff   tinfoil boxes   can take  r lef vers home in. Yet,  's really very tasty   feels very good for  . I've only had a few things  re that were genuinely bl .   price   reasonable     staff   lovely,     ambience   friendly.
However    canteen style ordering system really annoys   stresses me out. I've walked out of Cornucopia on several occasions ra r than go through   again. Basically,   way   food counter   (d )organ ed, if  re   any kind of queue (which  re usually  ),     just impossible   see any of   food. Especially   salads, which   at   very  p.

When   order   go   collect   pay  r food,  r way will   blocked by people trying   see   salads.

Depending when   go, Cornucopia can   busy making   difficult   find a seat.   seating  a   qu e large though, so give   a minute   someone   bound     up from h  table.

However, thankfully   new expansion means that no longer when     queuing up       go through intense worry that by   time   got     cashier   paid  re was no where   s  down   enjoy   delectable food. Th   came a big problem if   were w h a group as   can imagine.

Th  was often, regrettably a reason why I refrained from going desp e rating   food very highly. I am  refore delighted that an expansion has taken place meaning that no longer do I     let th  trivial matter of seating determine whe r I eat  re or not.   extension has taken place in   period building next door carrying on much of   same decorative hippie kibbutz  me as   original building. Cornucopia promotes an organic lifestyle     w hout question   foremost ve arian eatery in Dublin.

Inside very nice environment simple but elegant furn hings w h a b  of character.

  menu   middle eastern, one of my favor e food types so was looking forward    .

 s a l tle b  different    r normal menu. Starters   Deserts   platters of food sh d  tween   table. So   only dec ions       make    or  courses   what  r main course will  .

I like   when a restaurant has a lim ed menu,  s a sign that  y   taken time   produce a good selection of food   will   cooking   fresh. Obviously if     a fussy eater th  may not     place for  .

For starters we had soup, hummous, bread    b s   for desert   was chocolate ice cream, baklava   spiced fru . All very nice. For me   platters were   st  out part of   meal. Which     honest   generally my experience w h Middle Eastern food anyway.

For main course I had a lamb chop d h, plenty of meat   go around. I didn't think   lamb was particularly spiced in any way but   was pleasant enough. For sides  ir was some cous cous   ve ables which were very nice.

O r people at   table had    ef Kofta which was delicious ( I was pretty jealous of that d h )   someone   had Hake which looked good.

After  courses we were all pretty well fed, but   defin ely need   two courses   fill   up.

W h our food we had a bottle of Rose which was pretty nice   su ed   food well.

So when we went w h London friends last Saturday we were saddened   see we were directed   a new prem es next door (but still connected  )     old s e.  s HUGE   Full of canteen like tables in a canteen like hall w h minimal decoration. So far so different     old experience.   fact that   was only / full on a Saturday night did bot help   buzz but   way   sounds clattered off   b  walls was plain uncomfortable.   old prem es   still in use but th  night  y had decided   put a large group in  re   lucky  m!

But   food would     same, wouldn't  ? Actually no. Perhaps   was   greater dem  on   k chen, or a new k chen or different people, but   food did not     same hearty home cooked qual y I loved.   seemed more 'prep d' than I remem r   while I would not say   food was poor,   lacked any sense of pride or occasion I was expecting.   hummus was as lovely as ever but   sweet pota es   chopped ve ables looked puny   uninspiring.   Pide breads were tasty but skimped on   lamp  lly  ppings. All in all   seems as if an accountant   ruling over portion control.

  service was friendly but unexceptionable.  y  o seemed   lack   energy of  fore.

So please Bro r Hubbard. Make that hall more conducive   relaxed eating. Sack that accountant. Put groups in   bigger place   free up that old prem es.   back what made   place a delight     food,   decoration     cosy buzz."

I was always curious about baklava, but never ventured   try  . So I  ok a deep breath   dived in.   was so so good. One person at   table decl d   was   nicest baklava she's had. Wow.

We tried %   % of   menu   everything was impeccable. Bro r Hubbard   inspired by Med erranean flavors.  re's   L tle Bro r right next door which serves   same menu. We didn't     chance   go   S ter Sadie.

                             

   Light Breakfast   
Bircher Bowl: My  st friend's favor e  em on   menu. But who can reject a nice serving of overnight oats? Unfortunately, she was only able   eat two Bircher bowls over two days  cause on   last day we had   catch a flight   bircher bowls can't   taken   go. [Highly Recommend]

Porridge: Classic   simple.   jams   brown sugar gave   that extra oomph. If  're looking for something light, order ei r   bircher bowl or   porridge.

   Full Brunch   
Greek style omelette: Th  omelette felt like an egg s wich  cause  y provide sourdough bread. I   added smoked salmon   th .   made   whole d h more salty (especially w h   feta cheese   black olives) than I would   liked. Never less, still a wonderful wonderful omelette. After th  hearty breakfast,  'll defin ely   ready for   day.

Turk h eggs: Scrambled eggs w h  ma es   peppers. After eating   Greek style omelette,   Turk h eggs tasted more mild. I personally prefer   Turk h eggs more  cause  re was less feta   more  ma es.

Moroccan Special: H s down,    st poached eggs I've had.    pping was a smoky mix of eggplant,  ma es,   chickpea. I loved   spices! [Highly Recommend]

Pulled Pork S wich: We had   order   pulled pork s wich  cause   was app ntly    st s wich in Dublin. Like o rs, I didn't find   s wich THAT great. Out of everything we tried,   pulled pork s wich was my least favor e.

   Sweets & Desserts   
 lgian Chocolate Brownie w h whipped rasp rry cream:   rasp rry cream was   highlight here.   was airy   not a sugar overload. [Highly Recommend]

  Bro r Hubbard S'more:   cookie  self   a peanut butter cookie.   marshmallows   chocolate   on  p. Cookies   smores   always a good mix.

Plain Scone:   scone w h   orange blossom butter was so special! Easy   go breakfast.

Semolina Pancakes:    rry compote completed   pancakes. Th    something that can   sh d on  p an add ional breakfast  em.

   Drinks   
Coffee Cooler: Bro r Hubbard uses   coffee from fe.   coffee cooler came w h a syrup     coffee c rusy  cause of   orange slices infused in   drink. A refreshing energizer. [Highly Recommend]

Moroccan Green Iced tea w h Mint & Lemon: I ordered th  twice.  re   something d tinct about   iced tea that I can't descri . I'm not sure if  re were spices added     but   mint   something else about   made   taste very Moroccan.

                             

Whew, that was a really long review. If  're traveling, don't leave Dublin w hout trying Bro r Hubbard!

What I wrote on my last review still st s, though   business owner was kind enough   inform that  ir salt was perfectly soluble even though I thought   was simple coarse salt.

I had an egg s wich (no bacon),     was divine.   mamman egg was great, innovative,  but   egg s wich was  tter. Pastries   a wide array of yum. Mom said   fru  scone was good,   I liked that  y infused  ir water w h mint   lemon.

 y   a  autiful back patio  a w h live plants.   restaurant   immaculate. Ambiance   style was fun   creative.

I do   a quirky complaint...   place   small, even w h   offset room. No place   put  r purse while eating  cause   s ols   no backs     coat racks   usually qu e full.

Overall highly recommended breakfast s p. Don't go  o early or  'll m s v  ing some cute shops on   way as  y open later than one would expect."

We were able   grab   last window seats since  y're usually super busy   most people seem      re w h reservation. Sh d    course menu which I highly recommend.   was a fun experience   everything was delicious. Didn't even leave one speck of food  hind! Appetizer platter came w h a sample of everything. For   main course we ordered lamb   meatballs which came w h couscous   grilled veggies. Dessert sampler did a great job of  pping off our meal. Portions seemed small but I was stuffed   very sat fied w h my meal.

People seem     coming here for lunch but I think   dinner experience would   more worth   trip. Don't shy away from   set menu! All   food   c fully crafted   presentation   stunning."

  menu was very new   me at first. Many options I had never tried. But   comes w h a good description, so I chose th  Moroccan Spiced Chickpeas (or something like that).   was good   not so spicy.   latte I ordered was very good. I would come back just  cause of that.

On Capel Street, I didn't know what   expect. I am a fan of reviewing a menu of a restaurant  fore I go   pay   a v  , but sometimes when I'm really exc ed about going, I hold on    anticipation until   wa er h s over   menu   as if in slow motion.

I was not d appointed.

My craving for scrambled eggs was met    n some. I went for   Moroccan Style eggs   chorizo, au rgine   chickpeas in a spicy but sweet  ma  sauce, w h a side of scrambled eggs. My friend went for   pulled pork s wich   hailed as    st s wich in all of Dublin.   conversation flowed as I devoured   scrumptious d h. My only complaint   that I w h I had more!

Orla enjoyed   s wich, however asking for no mayo or mustard I'd say   was lacking in sauce.

My boyfriend has a b  of a sweet  oth, even in   mornings, so he went w h   hazelnut chocolate & banana pancakes.  Honestly, when we read   name of   d h,   sounded like   would   a simple pancake w h hazaelnut chocolate drizzle   bananas sliced up across, but   was even  tter than we imagined!   pancakes were fairly thin, more like crepes, dressed w h date infused mascarpone,  pped w h caramelized banana, drizzled w h a light hazelnut   caramel mixture   lastly, sprinkled w h rose petals.   was like eating pancakes that never s pped giving!

  Chicken Tagine was cooked well   very juicy, but   lacked much in   way of flavor.  , well, just tasted like chicken. I was looking forward   a b  more depth of flavor.   sauce was fine that   came in, but I found myself dipping more   more b es in, trying     some spice/flavor/interest/whatever!

  Charred Broccolini, Yellow  ans,   Red Pepper were exactly as  y sound. Very solid   if   chicke had had more flavor   would    en fine, but as   chicken didn't, I found myself not appreciating   veggies as much as I was still hunting around for some perfect b e.

  Spiced Cauliflower came   closest   only when adding   yogurt sauce.   yogurt sauce was   true st out   my dinner mate kept dipping h  chicken in   ( st idea of   night).

Service was decent   b  slow at times, but   was nice     a chance   catch up w h my dinner mate. Price was pretty good overall   I would   thought great if   meal had just had more flavor. Oh well, at least I did leave feeling like I had a healthy meal   some decent enough food."

I particularly don't underst  going out for a full Ir h breakfast... why would I pay upwards of € for a plate of grease requiring no culinary skill   put  ge r? Even hungover, I can operate a  aster, throw bacon in a pan   reheat a tin of  ans.

So that's my brunch rant,   w h one meal, Bro r Hubbard managed   change my att ude about   completely. Yes,  y   a brunch menu, but  's really food I could eat at any time.   Eggs Menemen   amazing! Soft scrambled just perfectly w h olives, baby spinach, roasted peppers    pped w h feta yogurt & mint... so much flavour   textures going on, w h   custardy eggs, fresh herbs, tanginess from   feta yogurt...

I   tried   Moroccan Iced Tea w h my meal. Again, delicious. I was  o full   eat anything else, but aside from  ir menu offerings,  y   had an entire counter stacked w h enticing fresh baked goodies. Prices   reasonable, w h most plates €   under,   very generous portion sizes.

O r reviewers mention long wa s, but when we went on a Saturday at noon, we were able     a table for  immediately.   was pretty full, but I didn't see anyone else wa ing outside. May  we just got lucky w h timing, but don't let that deter   from giving  m a try!"

    was fantastic. Still warm!   got an apricot roll which I was nervous about  cause I think   last time I got something similar I did not like   but th  was a subtle taste of apricot which made me love   as well. Can't comp      a warm brownie though....

I    en here  fore   was a very big fan of   place. My husb  was a b  more dubious , feels sometimes places like th  try  o hard. I encouraged him   try   again.

OK so first point   note ,I'm not sure if anybody has noticed but as of late  re   an abundance of really cool daytime coffee shops popping up around   c y    's suburbs that   oh so very accommodating   friendly.    could go    se places for hours , w h six   a half kids or a pile of books   only order one coffee    y actually smile   encourage     stay about.

So th  was kinda what i was expecting from bro r Hubbards when we rocked up   asked for a table for five . However  re was th  kinda awkward pause   when we gave our assurances   o rs were two minutes away  y gave us a free table ( re was ano r couple wa ing     ano r free table ) . We  n sweated bricks for   next  minutes as we wa ed for   o rs   arrive . But  y came  hallelujah !

Food was lovely as always ,   can't go wrong if   order anything here w h  ans ,yoghurt, pulled pork ,advocado ..or w h food in general. Yum.

  only thing that lets   cafe down     cramped seating which   not that comfortable. However,  ir home made goods more than make up for th  fault. Great   see an independent owner run cafe doing well. I am looking forward   going back again   sample more of  ir delights!"

Everything works perfectly here. Bruno     o r staff will serve   an amazing coffee,   way  's meant     brewed. Service   always efficient   delivered w h a pleasant manner.

Friendly   pol e staff. I felt welcome, taken c  of,   appreciated on my first v  .   lads working greeted us, gave us   information we needed   know about where   s , order,   hang.

Good grub. I ate   artichoke     goat cheese s wich on foaccia bread w h   cous cous as my side. I liked how fresh   veggies were   how nicely   food was plated. I liked   taste of my s wich   liked   cous cous alright  o. I think   cous cous could    en a scoop more for a serving   had more 'cous'.   was more watery  ma    cucum r.

H  side was a slaw that was a l tle b  bl .   veg was again very fresh, which   perfect for a crunchy slaw, but   dressing needed a b  of something w h more spice       not just tahini yogurt flavor.

 y   a smoke less back garden!   garden  a has layers of wood w h plants growing, tables arranged for grubbing or enjoying  r tea   coffee....    re's fresh air. Sold.   cafe  self   full of light   decorated well w h modern   vintage decor, but I was really feeling  ir garden  a.  's  ting colder in Dublin now, but I  t in   warmer months  s a popular spot.

 se reasons  n't l ted in any particular order,  cause  y're all important.   won't eat at a place that  n't clean or offering a good atmosphere,     certainly want   spend money on food   like   has   right flavor.

So, here goes.

Everything about   concept here   five stars in my book.  's fresh food made w h passion by people who take w h due grav y   serving of brekkie   lunch     check shirt wearing masses.  's 'clever use' philosophy (empty baking powder jars for sugar, why not?) underpins   slightly make   do/recycle cool feel of   place, carried through in   furn hings   general vi .

  menu   well judged, offering a reasonable but contained amount of choice.   soup   delicious.   salad plate, which I've had a few times,      ginning of my foodie problem.

For nearly ten euros, in a cramped eating space at a tiny table, or sh d one, I want my three salads     a meal. I want my hummus accompaniment     at least a tablespoon,  cause hummus doesn't do teaspoonfuls,   shouldn't even   asked  .  's like asking a drag queen   go on stage w hout fake eyelashes, or a half scoop of ice cream     served. Carrot hummus, no less. More, please.

For flavour,  se guys   full marks. Freshness   key, flavours   zingy   front   centre but   balance remains subtle. Balance of ingredients   content   where I'd  g   differ w h   salad minds  hind  se creations.   may   n my  sue w h portion size would   eliminated.

Example: a salad of cucum r in large chunks   always something of a tightrope  ing walked here in my book,   seeds   zingy dressing  n't enough, I want something   balance   texture   offer bulk (feta/olives?). Cous cous, when I put a forkful of that lovely carb in my mouth, I don't want celery, cucum r's equally diet obsessed cousin,       main texture   taste.   red cabbage slaw   yes, more please, but I need some carbs, man!   those l tle slices of bread  n't enough. I think  se guys could take a leaf out of Cornucopia's book here.

Deserts   excellent, those fancy fru  drinks that s  on ice highly refreshing,    y serve a mean coffee in   right size cup.

 cause     so incredibly cramped, even going in after   lunchtime rush won't mean  r neighbour   not dangerously close     for private conversations     carried out w h any degree of safety. I found out way  o much about   work chagrins of   lovely man w h   excellent diction  side us,   if he's reading th : I think  're right in   main, but I do think   need   take on board what  y're telling  ,  o.   can make   work w h a l tle b  of comprom e, I feel sure.

I've wa ed a while   wr e th  review  cause I live on Capel Street   wanted so much   love th  place.   first time I ate  re I was raving about     anyone who would l ten.   had just opened,   food was good,   staff were lovely     coffee was yum. My only complaint would    en that   s ols were uncomfortable    y sat o r people at   same, tiny, table as us (hello thighs   elbows of a stranger).

I've eaten  re a num r of times since. I still st  by   d comfort comment but   doesn't bo r me much, just means I wouldn't linger over my coffee for long   would   less likely   order cake after (no harm!).   food has, if anything, gotten  tter. Good selection, not just   usual suspects     can tell that none of   has just  en pulled out of   fridge.

But....

  coffee. I'm really confused about all   good reviews about   coffee here. I know about   provenance of    ans. I know one of   staff mem rs has one an award (hopefully not whomever has  en making my coffee). But on nearly every v   except   first (   re    en several,  's just down   street   I'm lazy..) my coffee has tasted burnt. No o r word for  . B ter  yond  lief w h a black h brown congealed crema. Undrinkable. I know th  happens every now    n so I let   slide   first time but mentioned       wa ress a few v  s later when   was still happening. She was nice enough   take   off   bill but informed me that  ir coffee   actually just unusual   different   I was probably just not used    ......   was a simple americano     was wrong. I like my coffee on   b ter side   I never add milk or sugar. I've had that blend elsewhere so I know   wasn't   roast,   was just waaaaaay over extracted. I'm   not   only one.   BF couldn't s mach   ei r (I've seen him drink Maxwell House  fore!),   normally he'd only love   opportun y   tell me   cop on     over myself.

I know   might seem harsh   take two stars for th  but I need a coffee w h my lunch so th    a deal breaker. I   hes ated   wr e   review, preferring   just tell  m myself   see if   was fixed but  y just pol ely (if not a wee b  patron ingly) d m sed   complaint as me  ing ill informed.

Please sort   out   I'll   a loyal local forever!

I ordered   Bakehouse Grill, which   a spread that comes w h a couple of eggs, a pork sausage, bacon, black   wh e pudding,   a thick hunk of  ast w h roasted  ma es   basically, an artery clogging mix on a plate!   was qu e delicious though. I admired    ast that was warmed nicely  fore  ing served. Although   menu doesn't say   can ask for   eggs scrambled or poached,   can     should.

I actually used   Yelp! app   help me find a place that was still serving breakfast.   re a lot of good reviews, so I thought why not?!    place   cute   has a retro, glam diner feel.  While I didn't     wa  for a table,   place was fairly busy for a Monday morning.  I was s ting near   door w h a good view of   baked goods d play.    while    ems in   d play looked lovely, like o r reviewers, w h   name   Bakehouse, I would   expected more bakery  ems.  I would descri  th  as a cafe.

I browsed   menu, but let's   honest, I was on a m sion.  So I ordered fry up    cause   was   warmest day I had experienced in Dublin, an iced coffee   go w h  .    iced coffee came in one of those Mason/Kilner jars w h a h le   a paper straw.    iced coffee was lovely  cause   was slightly sweetened... delicious.  That's about where things peaked.

When my food was brought out,  re was certainly a lot on   plate, but qu e a b  of   food looked dry.  I was hoping that I was wrong, but once I started digging in, nearly all of   was dry.  May  I v  ed at   wrong time... at   end of   breakfast.    biggest shame of   all was that   wh e pudding was so dry,   was hard...  I honestly think that   food had  en left under a hot lamp for a long time  cause   wasn't piping hot.  I feel like   food has potential   clearly  re   lots of great reviews, but on th  one v  , I didn't     experience   Bakehouse at  s  st :("

I've had a lunch a couple times, I think I've always had   baked pota  w h chicken though.  s fab!  y   a pink sauce that comes w h   that   just devine. Kind of a s which spread thing.

Service   pretty good,    y generally friendly.

Now, here's where I dock a star. I was in love w h thier baked goods. Seriously.   cupcakes were awesome,   muffins were mo t   had fillings in   centres,     apple & custard pastry was a thing   covet.  n,  y kind of went down hill. Muffins a b  drier, filling in   apple pastry pretty scarce, decreased selection etc. One day, when  y asked how   was, my OH spoke up   said that he wasn't as happy w h   apple pastries as  re was almost nothing in  m. She thanked him for speaking up   said  y'd talk     baker.   next time we went,  y were  tter, but still not up   previous st ards.   past few times I've gone in,  y   ei r had very l tle selection or a bunch of ""loaf slices"" which didn't appeal   me.

I ordered   farl, which was a large portion of bl ness.

Go here if  're starving   need   fill   void, but if  're looking for a place w h good food, good ingredients   stuff that  n't microwaved, try   wa    out."

Once finally seated we ordered americanos    ir fresh squeezed orange juice. Both were just ok.   food came fairly quickly, I had   bacon butty which,   my surpr e, was a s wich   near impossible   eat. My food   came out about  min later than   rest of my family.

I found   weird that   whole table was not served water which  came an  sue  wards   end of   meal. As well,   was very tight   crowded leading rob rs deafening conversation.

Lastly, when we left, we decided   try   of   breads from  ir d play cases. We were underwhelmed   threw out half   piece.

Overall just an OK place   would not return."

Ready for a tasty brunch on a Wednesday morning, I finally s pped by   cute cafe w h   pink fence.

  Bakehouse   in a great location   decorated well. I was honestly qu e impressed w h how smart everything looked.

When I arrived, a breakfast   brunch crowd was just leaving as   was a quarter   am. I asked   hostess if I could s  outside,   she led me   a table. She left   returned promptly bringing napkins   cutlery for me. She said she would give me a moment   review   menu     back shortly.

I sat   reviewed   menu  minutes   thought may  someone had forgotten   come back out, but sadly no one that appe d   work  re could   found.

I went back outside   wa ed.....

I did not   asked for my order, a coffee, water.... nothing. I sat  minutes  o long just trying     cool, patient,   underst ing of something delaying her/anyone.

Well, after  minutes I had   leave. HELLO, I was hungry   loosing my chance   eat  fore work.  :(

I went inside again  fore I officially left   could not find anyone who worked  re. Cus mers were s ting   eating (lucky....), so  y were still open. Why did no one come back   my table? I thought that was VERY strange.

I had read dozens of pos ive reviews  fore v  ing here, so I would actually still like   give th  spot a second chance. I hope     a more pos ive trip in   future, as I am a loyal cus mer   places that treat me right."

  Bakehouse has great reviews on Yelp, so we decided   head in for brunch/lunch at around  AM one morning.

  food was defin ely decent, though not   very  st I was able   experience while staying in Dublin,     heat inside made   ra r difficult   enjoy everything.

I mean, th  was one of   biggest portions of yogurt   granola I   ever eaten in my life.     was very good!   came w h a side of honey, some sort of jam,   a tiny cup of fru . I heaped   all in  one bowl, mixed   up a b ,   wound up gobbling   up exc edly like one of those kids in cereal commercials that holds  ir spoon like a hammer. I  n moved on    cheesy  ans, which were   delicious, although not trad ionally an American breakfast food like I'm used  .  y were piping hot   served in a tiny s ve pot. All of   food was presented in very aes tically pleasing ways. I w h I had grab d a pho , but I was far  o hungry   exc ed.

A couple of cons just   give th  post some balance:
    portion of fru  served w h   granola could    en bigger. I doubt I even got an entire straw rry. But like I said,   was one of   cheapest things on   menu.
   y didn't   hardly any change in   reg ter so we wound up having   ask people for smaller bills   coins, which was kind of annoying.

Not sure if   wasn't completely washed properly or if minuscule seeds were dropped in. I tasted       did indeed taste grainy, but  I was hungry enough   eat   anyways.   could    en done on purpose or by accident, ei r way,   didn't bo r me in   slightest. I doubt   was a hygienic  sue.

When   first came out,   was so hot...but I was so un lievably hungry that I scarfed   down which didn't   me tasting anything for   remainder of   night. I guess   paid off at   bar later on.

I realized I left my  rmos in   Bakehouse ten minutes after leaving, so I ran back   Bachelor's Walk   collect  .   wa ress had already put    hind   counter for safe keeping until I returned  typical Ir h kindness that   only   in   ""emerald  les."""

At first I had expected  ir specialties were breads, but   actually  ir soups or warm foods, I think.

[Chicken Salad]
In my first v   I ordered Chicken Salad served w h Turnover Bread.
  was relatively nice. Fresh ve ables, mo t yummy pieces of chicken,   nice dressing(French style: oil, vinegar, mustard...I suppose).
  portion was HUGE!    was hard   fin h, as served w h a bread.

  turnover bread was not bad, w h a l tle unique texture in  s dough: not  o soft, but slightly different from ""springy"".
I'm afraid    p was  o hard (not ""crusty"").
Honestly,   was not as fantastic as  I had expected, but for some reason I couldn't s p  , may   cause  s flavour was nice.

[Dublin Coddle]
Th  time I had Dublin Coddle,  cause of   severe cold.
  was served w h Brown Soda Bread.

Oh my god, I had   correct my impression (of a l tle d appointment), as th  warm coddle was wonderful!
 re   so many ingredients in  , from blocks of bacon,sausages   ve ables.
  flavour of   soup was brilliant, w h comfortable intens y,     was not simple enough   d tingu h completely what   was made from.
defin ely    st thing     on such a cold day!

  brown soda bread was not exactly   one I imagined.   was more like cake ra r than bread. Actually, I would say that   was 'a soft Scone w h a shape of loaf bread'.
Though   had such a gap from my imagination, I liked  .
(  'brown' refers   some very l tle grains mixed w h   dough, I suppose.)

In th  way, I found  ir specialties   kinds of soup or warm food.
I've never tasted any soup (  one I had was coddle), but    must   nice.
I   no idea about  ir cakes, so I must come back again   try one.

Lastly,   location, atmosphere     staffs   all lovely!

Once we were seated which was almost immediately after walking in   door, we were giving out orders w hin  minutes,   as we both ordered sammiches we had out food in like  minutes!

I had   bacon buttie which was unreal! Served on homemade bread   two fried eggs on  p of a savage rel h! Couldn't ask for more in a bacon buttie!

I ordered pancakes, o rs ordered pota  farls, sausage s wiches, mimosa   teas/coffees.

  pancakes came out   dear lord...I w h I didn't   my bowl of porridge that morning.  y were american style (I think!!), fluffy so I figure  y had ra ing agent.  re were two      y looked like a vic ria sponge cake w hout   cream or jam.  re was a lovely bowl of sweet blue rries, banana   maple syrup. I couldnt fin h  m   nei r could ano r friend.   sausage s wich was   nicest looking one I've ever seen!     pota  farl looked small but app ntly was awfully filling.

  tea   made w h tea leaves (yay!)     coffee good   strong.

My downsides? We were wa ing for ages for our order     turned out   was mixed up w h ano r table.   was fine for us as we were in no rush,   wea r had turned   I was catching up w h friends I  n't seen in a long time.
I   found    ilets     a b  dodge   no  ilet paper (but thankfully h  wels)   not so clean...  second place I went   th  weekend w h   same problem!

I will still go again though, a really large menu w h lots of things   try out!"

  food   simply lovely.   's a b  of fusion but not  tween two cultural mixtures but sort of a mix of classic favour es w h a modern tw t.  Everything   fresh   wonderful, something   notice w h every  em on   menu.   y     incorporated fresh baked pastries, breads,   o r baked  ems in  everything  y   so        st things a bakery can offer mixed in    ir café menu.  

  Guinness pies were delightful   all of   Bloomers,  ir take on a sort of Ir h fused crostini if   will, were   so good I couldn't decide which one I liked  st.    desserts   exactly what   would expect from a place called '  Bakehouse', an ample selection of pretty much everything   could ever w h for   every one   brilliant.

When   enter   Bakehouse,   feel as though  've  en transported back in time, straight in    k chen/living room of a 's housewife. From   decor     music,   all matches    me. Some of   staff even go along w h  ; one of   women (which I think     owner)   always dressed   styled as though she comes straight out of   movie 'Grease'. In General,   staff  re   really friendly   attentive, which adds     lovely feel of   place.

As for   food,  sides Breakfast during   week   Brunch on   Weekends,  y   serve Dinner Thu   Sat. I've only  en  re for Breakfast   Brunch, but I would assume that   food  y serve for dinner   just as tasty.

So how     food? DE L H.  y   a ra r small, but well balanced menu. From pancakes   Salads, Pota  Farls   S wiches    re's something for everyone   every appet e.  , all of  ir S wiches   served on  ir own, freshly baked bread. Depending on  r mood,   can     as a ""Doormat"" Version (thinly sliced bread) or   ""Doorstep""   thick slices of delicious, homemade bread w h a crunchy crust.   portions   generous     prices   very reasonable   defin ely great value for money. If after  r savory s wich   feel like sat fying  r sweet  oth,   Bakehouse provides a wide selection of delicious cakes   muffins. On  p of that,   can    ir freshly baked bread   take away.

Really,   only things that I w h   had would   more comfortable seating & slightly less b ter lattes. Th  will not, however, keep me from   rest of  ir w s. Defin e recommend for lunch!"

Almost all   patrons were American  ur ts, but that may   more a reflection of   time of day ra r than   type of place.

  cottle was lovely, w h big chunks of sausage   bacon as well as lots of onion   celery.   chicken soup was creamy w h plenty of chicken in big pieces, clearly from a roasted chicken. W h   green leeks in   creamy soup   made a tasty looking soup, which   was.

Just a wonderful place   come for soup or comfort food on a blustery or rainy day (  on any Dublin day   can usually fine one or both)."

I came in all   way in from Celbridge, Co Kild    eat   Bacon   Cabbage for lunch.

Th  Classic Ir h lunch   what   corned  ef   cabbage trad ion in   US   derived from. We can't   boiled bacon in   US  cause we butcher   cure   bacon differently. Trust me I   tried.

  woodwork   stained glass windows in th  pub  , according   our very friendly cheerful    autiful barmaid L a, original      pub.

  selection of  er on tap included all   would expect plus several craft  ers. So th  was all looking very prom ing.

 y serve lunch right up till . Brilliant.

Two orders for Bacon   Cabbage were placed   arrived fairly promptly.

But alas things started   fall apart food w e almost right away.

I immediately noticed  re was no parsley sauce w h   bacon   cabbage. Now that's just a No No as any self respecting foodie knows. B&C w hout parsley sauce   like  ast w hout marmalade.

I asked if chef could make some for us,  's a roué w h added milk   parsley.  minutes work  ps. But no.

    pota es were mashed, luke warm   we had   ask for butter.

Now in late July in Irel   's New Pota  season in full bloom. So serve  m boiled fresh   order ...  's Irel  for gods sake ... We've made a h  ry out of our spuds.

  cabbage was diced,   luke warm but delicious. I think   was mixed w h butter   perhaps some o r tasty fatty juice.

  bacon  self while  re was a lot of   was   d appointing. Cut like boneless pork chops   was b ly warm   very dry.

I'd recommend   chef take a drive   Kytlers in Kilkenny   see how B&C should   served.

  was a l tle tricky   actually       dining floor as I think  re was a wedding rehearsal dinner on   upper floor   people thought we were w h  m. After sorting   out we were taken   a lovely dining room w h big windows overlooking Trin y College. Dining was 'cozy' but no so much that we felt like our table neighbors were eavesdropping on our conversation. ;)

  first thing we tried that blew both myself   my friend away was   Ir h Soda Bread. Holy smokes, h s down    ST I've ever had! We were so impressed that we had   ask if  y happen   sh    recipe which   our surpr e,  's so popular that  y actually sell a mix! We, of course, bought two   take home.

 re were so many things on   menu that we wanted but narrowed   down     pea soup,   roast carrots appetizer    n I ordered   lamb while my friend ordered   Jerusalem artichoke salad.  Surpr ingly, our favor e d h was   carrots! I never knew carrots could   prep d in such a delicious way w h a decadent creamy cheese, some cr py fried sourdough   garn hed w h some lovely dried marigolds. Th    a MUST order here folks! My lamb was   divine   prep d perfectly w h nary a hint of gaminess.   only  em we found a tad b  d appointing was   soup, which while not terrible just didn't seem up   par w h   rest of   food.   was defin ely lacking in seasoning or some add ional flavor.

Service was great although  re was a slight error w h   soup timing but  y corrected   immediately.

  two course option was over by   time we got  re, so we ordered off   a la carte menu.  I enjoyed   Summer Squash Soup as a starter (seriously SO good)    n   Slow Cooked Lough Erne Sheperd's Pie pie as my main course, which was equally delicious, while my fiancé had   Pig  lly   really liked that as well.  I had  en planning   try out one of  ir desserts, but I couldn't even fin h my shepherd's pie  I was so full!  

O r than   food,   ambiance was comfortable yet still a b  elegant,     service was prompt   kind.  I will certainly   back when I am in Dublin again!"

Located up a narrow   somewhat uneven staircase     Pig Ear first floor restaurant.   s a pretty small bright room w h some nice views of Trin y College.   y service an early bird menu which   good value but we arrived at  so had   A la carte which was contained a wide selection of starters   mains   cover most tastes.   re     an allergy statement added at   bot m which   useful.

  wine l t   excellent   very well priced.  We had a bottle of   Salice Salentino which at euro a bottle was good value.

  highlight was   Shepards Pie   anyone that can transform a d h from something so simple   something so rich   tasty   doing something right.  For desert   cheesecake served in a jar deconstructed     was rich, creamy   whipped."

I must say that after reading some reviews my main worry was   service,  however that  o was excellent   in a few lines I'll go in  more detail about that.

First impressions: we rang  m on   same day (a Saturday) about a booking for .  y  ld us  y could only book us for  but we needn't worry or rush, as  re would still   plenty of people around   we could stay til after .

  can't m s   bright pink door that leads   a well l  stairwell.   don't need   climb that much   reach   first level of   restaurant. We arrived about min previous   our reservation but, instead of rushing us out in    cold street again,  y offered   call us from   pub next door as soon as our table was ready.   so  y did.

We went up     second floor,   a much more intimate   dim l  dinning room than downstairs. Both   host     wa er we got were very friendly   easy going, our wa er in particular was qu e ener ic   made simple things like uncorking a bottle a b  more entertaining   delightful. As soon as our host found out we were portuguese he even attempted a few words every time he went by.

 fore   bread   butter couvert (even th  was yummi   well presented) we ordered a bottle of wine, which was very easy  cause  ir l t   qu e good   reasonably priced.   whole food menu looked delicious as well   we started w h a Ven on Tart    Jerusalem Artichokes.  se were very tasty d hes, rich in both v ual   palate pleasing textures.
However   mains were   true highlight of   meal.   wild Ir h game Ven on was  autifully cooked,     meat still rosy inside matched    rries in   d h.    ef cheek w h bone marrow was ano r delicious d h, a b  more rich   saturated in flavours, but made   want   lick   plate clean in   end.

After all th  we couldn't possibly skip dessert! Th  was probably my least favour e thing, but that only means that   was good instead of absolutely great. I got   Cuinneog Farm buttermilk sor t   while   tasted good,   felt  o watery, as if   d h wasn't holding very well  ge r.   Cheesecake though   not     messed w h, serious food black magic going in  re!

We  ok our time, had a nice espresso,   got out a b  after . Just as  y had prom ed! Th  was a perfect dinner experience   I'm just wa ing for an excuse   go back   sample   lunch menu ^^"

Considering how expensive we knew Dublin    ,   our bud  for   weekend, we were a l tle taken aback at   prices an decided   order off   A La Carte menu instead   lessen   cost.

I chose a Pheasant d h which was really stunning     meat had lots of flavour   every garn h on   plate worked really well   included parsnips   root ve able cr ps.  My only problem   something out of control of   chef   was that   bird had clearly  en shot through   breast      a around   was very bloody   dark.    whole d h was  autiful though   Sam pol hed off    as I didn't fin h!
 
We decided   treat ourselves   sh    'Pigs Ear Cheesecake' for dessert     presentation was   most charming I've seen.    came     table in a pink & wh e striped paper bag, which, when opened up, revealed a jam jar filled w h   upside down cheesecake, cons ting of chocolate b cu  crumb, cream cheese mix   caramel sauce.    tasted as good as   looks   I could   eaten   twice over.  

  was an expensive meal   very much a one off for us   we loved   food but  's defin ely somewhere for special occasions!    feels slightly unfair giving   Pig's Ear three stars considering   food was really tasty, but my bloody pheasant     shock of   change in menu     prices   just knocked   down for me.

I made a booking a few days in advance   didn't   trouble  ting a table for two on a Saturday. A three course meal   €.   w hout knowing much about here apart from   reviews, I was exc ed   try   delicious sounding Ir h menu.

 re's only three options for starters/mains so Graeme   I ordered   same d hes (something we normally try   avoid!). We started w h a cr py pig's head croquette w h ardo, tarragon mayonna e, apple, spiced prunes followed by slow cooked duck leg w h pear   oatmeal crumb (  menu description online doesn't seem   match what we had!).

I love a croquette, in fact I want   start some kind of croquette appreciation club (who's w h me?!).   pig's head croquette was up  re w h some of   most epic croquettes I've ever had   pleasure of eating   immensely meaty w h a delicious cr p crump   lovely accompaniments.  

  duck leg was just as tasty, soft   tender w h a really rich flavour.   squ  of black pudding was just what I needed   convert me   black pudding as   was really mildly spiced   added a lovely kick     d h.

We'd   ordered a side salad of peas, broad  an   Parmesan which was a lot more delicious than   might sound    tween us we scoffed   lot. I was really impressed w h   generous covering of Parmesan     peas were super fresh   perfectly cooked.

For dessert I opted for   Cashel blue cheese. I really wasn't going     dessert but after how   o r d hes were, I knew I had   try  .   was served w h a really strange, large wooden knife which may  makes me a complete im cile but I couldn't really work   w h   cheese   cr p bread. Thankfully   just meant that    ok me ages   eat   I got   enjoy   for even longer.

Service was good, helpful   always on h  but never over aring. Sure,   bill ended up  ing kind of pricey but   was worth  .   Pig's Ear   up  re w h some of    st meals I've had, anywhere   defin ely takes   crown for    st meal in Dublin (so far, I'm here for ano r  days! I'll do an update if somewhere takes over!)"

I don't give five star reviews often but th  place defin ely earned   for me. Hopefully next time I make     Dublin, th  place   still around   still as great.  

We had (w h our two  ng children):
  cured salmon, delicious   almost but not qu e raw in  s texture

I popped along on a sunny Saturday afternoon after a b  of shopping on Graf n Street.   restaurant   on Nassau Street, easily recogn able by   gorgeous bright pink door! We bundled up a small set of stairs   went in    first floor of   restaurant.  re    dining rooms which all face on  Nassau Street   as  y   on   elevated floors     gifted  autiful views out  ward Trin y College. I would   loved     seated on   higher level but th  particular evening   seemed pretty full up  re! We were delighted     a lovely seat next      autiful windows though, a lovely spot   eat while   evening closed in.    dining room   simple   cosy   has a comfortable, laid back atmosphere.
We were given   menu   look over   presented w h a gorgeous l tle bag of fresh bread   butter. As per usual I had zero willpower   pol hed off   major y of th !
We decided   order from   Early Bird Menu, offering  courses for €. or  for €.. W h a choice of  starters,  mains    desserts   may    en a slightly shorter menu than some restaurants but in saying that w h a meat, f h or veggie main course option most will easily fancy one or more of   choices!

  start I chose   Cr py Pig's Head Croquette compr ed of Lardo, Tarragon Mayonna e & Apple. I'll   honest,   Pig's Head part made me slightly nervous ... I will try most meat or f h but   image of eating meat from a pig's head  n't  o pretty! However, I adore croquettes   was pretty sure once I tasted   that   piggy's face would   forgotten     I was right!   croquette was cr py on   outside w h  autifully soft   well seasoned meat inside.   pairing w h apple worked very well as always.

While Mam  n't a ve arian, she  n't big on meat o r than chicken   very r ly eats f h so   options of pork or salmon were out for her. Luckily she does like goat's cheese as   last choice was Gold River Farm  etroot w h Burnt Apple, St  la Goats Cheese & Pickled Onions. How fabulous     presentation on th  d h?! I had a small slice of   cheese     was delicious, so soft   creamy.

For my main I decided on   f h... Pan Fried Cod w h Broccoli Purée, Salt Cod Mash, Broad  ans, Carrots & Brown Shrimp. Th  d h was so good   light, fresh   simple but perfectly cooked.   f h fell apart in flakes     was an all round well balanced d h.

Mam decided on   Chicken Breast w h Sweetcorn, Smoked Garlic Pota  & Grilled Lettuce. I don't often order chicken when I'm eating out as I     so much at home, but on   occasions I do, I real e how badly I cook  . Throwing   in  a stir fry   eating dry chicken really makes me appreciate how amazing a piece of well cooked chicken can  ! Th  was soft   mo t   so tasty.

We decided against a dessert   just sipped over our glasses of wine, enjoying   relaxed feel   our meal.   Pig's Ear offers fantastic food in a comfortable environment   should defin ely make   on   r l t on ""Must Try"" restaurants in Dublin!"

I end up w h ""Old Fashioned Pork & Bacon Brawn w h Pea Puree & Cider Jelly"" for starter.  Since I never had Brawn  fore, I did a b  of research.      basically head cheese, I was a b  dubious but I figure what   heck,   only live once!   sides, I felt  's my duty   order something pig b s in a restaurant w h 'Pig' in  s name!

Anyway,     pretty tasty.   's kind of like a pate w h big chunks of meat in  .    's sweet   savory all at   same time.  One of my s ter in law had   salmon,     was delicious.

For   main course, I had Jane Russell's Original Pork Sausage w h Spelt Pearls, Granny Sm h Apple & Cider Onion.  Th    when I fell in love w h th  place.    pork  lly   like heaven in  r mouth.      mash   just like  tally awesome good.  I really like   add ion of Spelt Pearls.  

  of course, we         dessert!   y ran out of chocolate, so I picked   Camel ed Lemon Rice Pudding w h Rasp rries   orange.   was very tasty but   was way  o heavy for me.  I felt like I just ate a big lunch of mushy rice.  I tried some of   cheese cake,     was so good!  I probably would pick that next time.

We had  en walking around all day   were very hungry, which probably added   our declining mood, but we did not receive our entrees until : .

When our food arrived,   was simply average (my salmon was overcooked),   we just wanted     out of   restaurant as soon as possible.

  only redeeming part of th  evening was that our wine was complimented   we received small desserts   go as we rushed   leave. However,  minutes of kindness does not make up for an entire evening of bad service.

Pig's Ear, desp e   name that sounds more like a Chinese cold d h or a pub, manages   pull   off. A small upstairs restaurant w h a view of Trin y College,   boasts modern interpretations of... meat.

  Hen's Egg: I'll   honest   adm  that I never knew or paid much attention   what   egg was mixed w h, but   combination worked.
  Pork  lly: Th  ""pork  lly"" was effectively a giant slab of bacon making that even at Peter Luger in   States look meager in compar on.   meat/fat ratio was about / which, while still  o heavy for   health conscious, was magically delicious.
  Brown Bread ice cream w h Carmelized Brown Bread: True     Ir h trad ion of starch. I enjoyed th  more than   'homemade' ice cream at Murphy's nearby. My only minor quibble was that   carmelized bread was sticky   hard enough      ffee like which I wasn't expecting.

Based on   current menu, if I returned I'd probably order   same things. Based on   prices I don't think I'd come for   full dinner    even on an expense account   would   above my allowance    but I'd defin ely return again for   early bird that was worth eating at Dublin lunchtime   partake."

By far    st thing at th  place     cheesecake.    comes in a l tle Mason jar     very light   fluffy. I w h I'd   got about  or    go when I left  y were that good.    overall atmosphere was a b  upscale   I recommend     on appropriate attire. I felt completely underdressed in jeans   a coll d shirt. I would   not recommend th  place for small children. I  ok my month old w h me   got weird looks from everyone when  y saw him. Thankfully he was well   d or who knows what could   happened.  y had no highchairs for kids   no place   change a kid.  I had no major  sues w h taking my baby  re however I would caution o rs w h kids   recommend a more kid friendly place.

Terribly quaint in  s drawbacks from our  th w h such simple  uches as a wee Suicre bag of sugar w h a spoon put on   table w h coffee, awesome Yellowjack (think Crunchie honeycomb, only MUCH MUCH  tter) w h brown bread ice cream.

  key here was presentation.  My pork & ham knuckle brawn appetizer was served in a teeny l tle potting jar on a b  wood board, w h a schmear of carrot jam   pickles.    was both delicious   very quaint.

When I got my main course of smoked haddock on cauliflower champ, I thought   myself, I would never   full.  But   portion sizes were just perfect   we all left  re sufficiently satiated.

I went for   early bird menu, . EUR for two courses?   can't go wrong. For starters I had   Carrot soup, which was very tasty   very filling.

For   main I got   Pork  lly.  re was surpr ingly very l tle meat on  . Now I know pork  lly has a lot of fat on  , but  re was like % fat, if not more. But that said,   was very good.

I sh d a desert,   brown bread ice cream     was divine. Highly recommend  .

  wine we went for was   house sauvignon blanc on   first page, which was very very nice   good value. Apologies for not remem ring   name. I can't find   wine l t on  ir s e.

My mo r had   Pea & Mint R ot  w h Broad  ans &  asted Pine Nuts which she was wary about at first but fin hed   all off   said   was very flavoursome.

For Dessert I ordered   cheese cake which was served in a jam pot     looked like   crumbs of a digestive b cu  where sprinkled on  p of   light   gorgeous cheese cake.  

My Dad like a true Dub had   Gur cake which he said reminded him of  ing back in s Dublin, so   was   real deal. My mo r had   cheese cake   we all had  americanos.

  sugar was served in a bag of Siucra which my mo r commented that  years ago people would give out about but   was perfect for   setting    y pulled   off well.

All in all a fantastic dining experience which combines, friendly staff, flavoursome food, novel presentations, good value   a great view.   We will certainly   back.

Search for (e.g. taco, cheap dinner, Max's)

'Ir h'

Near (Address, C y, State or Zip)

'Dublin, Irel '

Main course was   much esteemed salmon   mash.  A win!  Probably poached salmon was served w h cr py skin from a spin under   broiler.  Perfectly cooked (never asked my preference), w h flakes that melted in   mouth.  Mash champ was   a winner.
Rest of   restaurant   cozy; dining room   on   second floor looking over Trin y College, Dublin, where books remain preserved for   years due     academic excellence (or lack  reof) of  s students.  Overall, a huge improvement over   d aster that was   Winding Stair, Dublin.

Starter:
  smoked mackerel melted in my mouth. Perfect for sharing w h ano r person; all   need   a taste! Try   French Sauvignon Blanc; complemented   mackerel nicely.   should know that   mackerel   from   Burren!

Main course:
  Atlantic Salmon served over champ mash rocked my world.   could taste   freshness as though   poor lad was swimming around in   ocean deep shortly  fore ending up on my plate.   flavor   texture was an eaters delight. I   tried   pork  lly   black pudding. For Americans:   reminded me of    st pork br ket smoked slowly that falls apart when forked.

Dessert:
  port ( y only had ) was hearty yet smooth. Had   chocolate tart that boasted homemade vanilla ice cream.   tart was  pped w h chocolate ""pop rocks"" that had me thinking of my childhood, remem r those?   chocolate   port went very well  ge r, no doubt   will a great experience for    o.

 ing glut nous pigs, we decided   go for    course lunch. We both opted for   crab starter w h celeriac   apple salad   very light   refreshing.   buttermilk dressing was a tad  o watery for my liking but delicious none less. My idea of a perfect summer salad   hope  y keep that on   menu for   next few months.

We diverged on mains   duck conf  pie for me     roast rib for   o r half.   duck conf  pie was sweet   richly spiced (I think Chinese  spice was in  re somewhere). Ok so   duck leg sprouting out of    p of   pie was a b   atrical...but seriously that pie was so good, I wanted a second helping. Portions for lunch   pet e but perfectly formed    's defin ely enough food for lunchtime. Husb 's roast rib looked excellent   he did say   tasted a l tle dry.

For dessert, I opted for   chocolate tart w h caramel   salted butter ice cream. Tart was INSANELY rich   really needed more than   ice cream   cut through   richness. I love chocolate but found   chocolate in th  a b  overwhelming.   ice cream was divine! Husb  loved   brown bread ice cream but thought   apple compote flavor got lost. While I like   idea of dessert  ing served in a Mason jar, in real y,  's qu e hard   physically   at  r food. He looked like he was struggling a b      spoonfuls of   compote.

Service was superb   we were treated gently, not bo red   not forgotten entirely.   dining room   small but even w h   lunch crowd,   didn't feel stuffy or  o tight (no one's elbows on  r table   always a bonus!). I'll   back soon for ano r long, le urely lunch!"

A fabulous departure from   st ard (  equally lovely) pint of well poured Guinness   pub food. Many establ hments assuredly do  se classics qu e well, but take a pop in  L Mulligan    'll   a b  of a different experience...

Craft  er, well curated wine l t, small batch liquors...  works.

I had a Dr. Rudi ( lgian style Ale brewed in Irel !)   a  lfast Blonde. I enjoyed both but could've probably kept drinking   blondes due    ir lighter punch.   Haddock   chips (Jenga chips!) were especially tasty (my first f h 'n chips since arriving    se stretch of  l s)      my manpal had   bangers   mash.  I was so full, I could've burst, but I couldn't help myself. SO SO good.

Staff   extremely on point, friendly, knowledgeable, quick   would surely make me want   return.   did!

As many   mentioned, L Mulligan manages   do k sch w hout cheese. Menus tucked inside old books, bills delivered in pencil cases, some salvaged tables...a b  of unique w hout slapping   in   face w h  . I found   qu e sad that  y had   put a PSA in   menu about people not stealing  ir stuff. C'mon people    don't steal ANYTHING from a business, let alone a small business. Thought   was qu e cute that  y've got an ""amnesty box"" for any of those wayward folks that may   tipped a few  o many   gotten a l tle grabby. BRING   STUFF BACK!

Anyway, rant over. Th    a lovely place   I'd   a regular if I lived in Dublin. If     a local or a traveler    defin ely pop in   try   for  rself.  's warm, friendly, cool, great food, great drinks   a fantastic staff. What more could   want?

We started our meal by sharing a very tasty pâté which came w h some fine sourdough bread   th  was more than enough for two     friendly staff had no problem when we asked for more bread   fin h off   pâté.

B had   very popular d h of moules fr es which was flying out   k chen   filling   dining room w h a heady f hy aroma. I  ok   advice of our knowledgeable  wa er   went for   chicken Kiev which came w h sides of double cooked chips, creamed sweet corn   a spicy  etroot slaw. Both our d hes were superb   in my experience classic pub food does not come much  tter than th  ....

We washed all th  delicious food down w h a very nice bottle of  eluna  rrontes.  Unlike a lot of o r craft  er pubs   Grocer has put a lot of thought in   s small but interesting wine l t.

By th  point we were on   verge of a food coma so we skipped   lovely looking dessert menu.

While wa ing for   very reasonable bill (don't worry   bill here will not break   bank     excellent value for money) we had a quick coffee   a cheeky glass of Redbreast from   extensive wh ky l t  fore heading back ""home""   a return v     already  ing planned."

Staff   very friendly. We had a long chat w h one of   owners about  ir  or so bottle wh key collection   sampled a couple of excellent suggestions.

I had  en reading  anrow ( anrow.com) for a few weeks   enjoying   innovative recipes focused on products sourced from in   around Dublin.

Hubs   I sh d twice cooked chips w h aioli dip, steamed mussels,     potted crab & sourdough soldiers  all of which was exqu  e.   crab was served cold but was fresh   flavorful.   mussels tasted of rich broth   didn't   a single unpleasant grain or closed shell.

As a fan of microbreweries I was glad   see a huge  er l t including microbrews from Dublin, some goodies from California,   a  n of my favor e imported  ers on tap. We washed down our dinners w h a Hoegarden as big as my head   hubby's Molly's Chocolate S ut. I can honestly say I'll   back soon   trying everything on   menu. Nothing was mediocre, everything was high qual y...friendly, attentive service  ing   icing on th  particular locavore cake."

For me that meant a trip     Metalman tap followed by one of  degrees' Reds. Great     able   drink craft Ir h  er  se days : )

We got a table after about  minutes,   had an excellent meal. All my earlier comments apply: great staff, strong sense of humour in menu, staff,     ""l tle  uches"" (e.g. bag of gummy sweets w h   bill). Food was really good     mussels     black pudding stuffed chicken  ing some of   highlights.

  food was tasty but not everything I'd dreamed.    wasn't  o hard   choose what I wanted, seeing as I could only eat three of  ir offerings.  I know pork   big in fall, but really?

We started w h wild mushrooms sauteed in blue cheese, on sourdough.    effete cousin of  ans on  ast, th  starter was melty, tangy, salty   overall great.    sourdough  ast was really sour, cutting through   creamy cheese,   both parties proclaimed   a success.  Five stars.

As for   mains, I chose   butternut squash tagine while my friend  ok a  ef stew w h croquettes.    couscous was really dry under my butternut,     squash was nice but tasted more  ma ey than tagine spiced.    stew, however, was nice.     ef was tender     croquettes, I heard, were tasty.  Three stars.

For dessert, we splurged on   chocolate s ut mousse, made w h Molly's Chocolate S ut from Hilden.  Mousses should   thoroughly blended but we both felt   s ut flavour came in   out incons tently throughout   mousse, w h some b es s ut free   some overly b ter.  Four stars.  

When we got   bill,   came w h a l tle paper bag filled w h gummies (jellies,    y, here?)   cute but stale.  . stars for   effort.

When in   neighbourhood again, I'll return   see how   menu evolves w h   seasons.   , of course, I'll come back for    er selection.  When I say extensive, I mean  : two pages of bottled  ers, a full page of wh k(e)ys... th      place      r drinking snob out   flaunt  .  Four stars."

I had had food in ano r pub but as always I am interested,   gauge pubs, by  ir food selection   prices. But th  seems     a challenge, or at least   was   me on th  night.

 ir drinks,   food     rumoured, menus come in old books. Yes I saw drinks menu upon drinks menu in books but I couldn't seem     my h s on a food menu. I was informed, by a friend w h us that   would   along   Porterhouse prices   which   fine by me   so I will take her word for  .

  eating  a   a big light space w h chunky wooden tables   comfy chairs in green or blue.   menus   changed on a weekly bas      served in old books. Each d h comes w h a suggestion of wh kies (which   not an easy task w h over  wh kies available).

  incredible menu sports local produce,     can see, taste   smell   difference.   food   ue rphenomenal good.
(I think   might   guest by now I really like th  place   am a huge fan of modern Ir h cu ine).
   er menu   fascinating  o   multiple different Ir h  ers & over  imported once.

We ordered Scotch Egg (comes w h a yummy mustard mayonna e) & Black Pudding w h rhubarb rel h. I never had scotch egg  fore, but I'd go anytime for seconds in Mulligan's.
As mains we picked a Carrot, Mushroom   Hazelnut Tartlet, served w h lemon mash   Pork  lly w h black pudding mash & a variation of sauerkraut on   side (  most delicious thing ever,   contained ra ins, cumin, mustard seeds   was not fully fermented like   real German stuff     was that good we were having a lil fork war over   ;) ).
We could not res t   order   twice fried chips on   side   oh   glory of  se chips will not   forgotten. That's how all chips should taste!  y were accompanied by a lovely chives  lemon  mayonna e dip. ( Yes     incredible where   how   can use lemon   how   transforms   taste   something fresh, summary, light   incredible tasty)   I actually still feel   sensation of   chips paired w h   dip on   tip of my  ngue   yumyumyum.

  service was perfect  o (  I do not say that often cos I am a fairly picky girl). Friendly, attentive, no long wa ing   cutlery including serviettes were changed  tween courses (yes   sounds a l tle b  n  picky, but  se small l tle details make ALL   difference).

At   end of   meal   bill was served in a l tle ruler box including jelly's in a bag!
Where else would      !?

I'd recommend th  pub for a great couples night out or a fantastic night w h friends (tables   big enough for large groups &   choices of  er & wh ky wont make   want   change   pub all night long)."

I had taken   precaution of booking a table earlier that day which was w e as even on a Wednesday night   dining  a at   back of   pub was full by ..
We started our evening w h a  er s ting on some high s ols at   front of   pub. Lots of original dark wood, plenty of old school atmosphere   a nice mix of local folk    ur ts.  re   a great selection of  er  not that much on cask but plenty of choice on keg   from   bottle. Not a Guinness tap in sight  th    a craft  er pub   proud of  .
  main eating  a   cosy   our fellow diners were a mix of romantic couples   larger groups.   scrabble reserved signs on tables   menus in old books might seem a l tle twee in o r places but somehow   all works qu e well at   Grocer.
We started our meal by sharing a very tasty pâté which came w h some fine sourdough bread  th  was more than enough for two     friendly staff had no problem when we asked for more bread   fin h off   pâté.
B had   very popular d h of moules fr es which was flying out   k chen   filling   dining room w h a heady f hy aroma. I  ok   advice of our knowledgeable wa er   went for   chicken Kiev which came w h sides of double cooked chips, creamed sweet corn   a spicy  etroot slaw. Both our d hes were superb   in my experience classic pub food does not come much  tter than th  .
We washed all th  delicious food down w h a very nice bottle of  eluna  rrontes. Unlike a lot of o r craft  er pubs   Grocer has put a lot of thought in   s small but interesting wine l t.
By th  point we were on   verge of a food coma so we skipped   lovely looking dessert menu.
While wa ing for   very reasonable bill (don't worry   bill here will not break   bank     excellent value for money) we had a quick coffee   a cheeky glass of Redbreast from   extensive wh ky l t  fore heading back home  a return v     already  ing planned."

Vintage Cocktail Club (VCC) more than f    bill   our immense sat faction.

  find th  spot,       go up one of   side streets in Dublin's Temple Bar, not far from   central part of   drag where   Quays     actual Temple Bar   located. W h   outdoor seating only available at   time      club had tables outside   usually d creet doorway (w h no noted signage)     roof p accessible by   stairwell. Desp e   restrictions at   time, my wife   I had some great craic  re.   manager who owns   business accommodated us wonderfully, ensuring we had what we needed as we ordered dinner   drinks. She gave us flutes of prosecco on   house since we just had our Celtic marriage ceremony on   oppos e side of Irel  in Doolin; a lovely gesture indeed!    cause   was cold out    we didn't think   put on our jackets  fore leaving   hotel,   manager brought us blankets   cover ourselves since we were s ting outside   front entrance on   first night.

  burger I ordered was fabulous, incredibly savory,   sat fying     last b e.   mixolog ts  re create very magical cocktails that we ordered more than one from VCC's extensive drink menu booklet.   Rosy & Jim was a delicious blended Ir h Wh key drink w h rosemary infused Rhubarb Liqueur   homemade simple syrup w h a rosemary skewer. From  re, I enjoyed a Sou rn Passion, which compr ed p co (Peru's national liquor), apple,   passion fru  w h a cool passion fru  coin on    drink as garn h.

We loved th  spot so much that we returned here on our final night in Dublin  fore flying back home, where we  ok seats at a table at   roof p bar. We enjoyed some more classic cocktails like  ir Mai Tai   Navy Grog. Both rum based cocktails were exqu  ely made   very strong      former more orange   c rusy while   latter had more grapefru  notes. Fin hing off w h   Wobbler that had ruby grapefru  infused vodka, Fernet Branca,   Port wine, we certainly had a night of nights at VCC.

She pointed us   two cocktails on   menu & we ordered away.

  cocktails were delicious! So we ordered more, but by th  time (around )   place had started     busy w h food cus mers so   service was a l tle slow (probably wouldn't   hurt     a second bar man on by that time on a Saturday).

I'm giving   place  stars.  re   no prices on   menu,   while we expected       a b  pricy I think € for  drinks was extreme   especially considering our drinks didn't   excessive amounts of alcohol (I mean my second drink was a margar a so just a shot of tequila in  re & may  some orange liquor if  y were  ing fancy).

While sipping on  se exqu  e creations, we enjoyed some snacks   small plates. Although   food was very good, I should   left       drink. W h all of   unique   subtle flavours   notes that  're tasting in each sip of  r drink,   food slightly masks   greatness in each of   drinks.

I will defin ely   back   VCC, although I might need   wa  until next pay day as   drinks   a b  pricey, but  tally worth  !!!!"

TH  ONE.

Th  place   just perfect on every aspect.

When   enter   bar,  's as if   just did a jump  years ago.   image turns   black   wh e around  ,     see  r life on a cinema film.

  cocktails   simply delicious.
I mean 'delicious' like in 'deliiiiiiiiiiii hhhhhhhhhhhouuuuuuuuus omagaaaaaad I'm dyiiiiiiing'.
  ALL of  m   incredible, not only a few.
 y must   hundreds of cocktails on  ir menu,   each one I tried were gorgeous (  I tried more than  now).
  taste    ir perfect technique only equals  ir creativ y.
My mouth   watering right now as I imagine just reading   menu: Dirty wizard, w h chilli infused vodka, fresh rasp rries   mint.   Mary Pickford, w h wh e rum, sharp rasp rry, sweet pineapple   maraschino.
  Morning Glory, w h wh key, cognac, absin , b ters, curacao   c rus fin h.   Tequila Mockingbird (I volunteer, as tribute!), w h tequila, medium pear & c rus, floral violet & walnut.
I don't   enough tastebuds   enjoy  m at   level  y deserve.
But trust me,  y   as n hing.
*extatic sound*

  staff     extremely knowledgeable   nice, knows   menu enough   give great recommendations.   don't find anything that makes   dream?
Don't worry,   barman will know how   send   in ano r world.

I   tried   food, having pretty low expectations.   mamma mia, I was so stupid   ever think  y would d appoint me  re,  o!
  arrancini were   die for,   mini pork  lly burgers one of    st I ate,   I'm still b ing my lip when I think about  ir brie   prosciut  grilled cheese.

Finally,   location. For  New York's speakeasies, just enter   magic of Vintage cocktails club.
Here   go, in   middle of temple bars, where  ur ts   fighting     a seat in ano r pub, in   middle of o r  ur ts, l tening   all   same  ur ty music, looking for   Dubliner's experience in   place where no dubliner would ever go drinking.
A small door w h  letters, ""VCC'.
Squeezed  tween  shops,   would never expect such a place here.
But   just knock on   door,   a bouncer opens   door, letting   in on   vintage carpet, opening  se  stairs of pleasure, ready for  r  st bar experience.

  was pretty expensive overall, but everything was worth  :   cocktails   one of    st of my life,     food   in enough quant y   fill  .

My recommendations, now : First, try   cocktails w h two stars on   menu ( ir special ies!).
  BOOK AHEAD, in order     a nice table   not     all squeezed in upstairs.

But please, please...

...Always keep me a seat!

  VCC   not   most obvious place in   c y.  re's a blackened window    n a door, w h   in ials.   that's  .

But I found     when I entered, I got a glimpse of what was inside; lovely old fashioned upholstered chairs w h tables.   decor was elegant. As if   were going in  a l erary salon.   I could see how th  place could seem like a great place for a cocktail, or some champagne. However, like I said, I went for brunch.

Unless   hear about   (through YELP, Buzzfeed, etc),   wouldn't know that  y served brunch at   weekend.  re's a lovely selection of old favour es   I was delighted w h my french  ast, scrambled eggs   bacon. I even had a freshly squeezed orange juice. Very tasty.   not terribly expensive.

  service was ok, a b  sleepy,   I felt  y were trying     rid of us even though   was half empty. May   o many cocktails   night  fore?!

I've  en here a couple of times w h my girlfriend   a few pals     never fails   amaze me that such an establ hment ex ts in a place like Temple Bar. Whenever I talk   anybody about where   go for scoops in   c y th      first one I mention.  's like ano r world.

 's eclectic.  re's a  s Art Deco feelw h general vintage sh  thrown in as well; silver ceiling, dead animals on   walls, comfy armchairs.  re's a load of cocktails, old   forgotten (including Don Draper's Old Fashioned, un lievable), classics   tropical concoctions. I'm all about   wh key myself, so I usually   an Old Fashioned or something similar.   tropical cocktails   fru y   fresh   brilliantly balanced;   y were all individual in texture, taste   presentation.   can tell  y're made by people who know what  y're doing.

While   cocktails   lovely,  's   attention   details that really  s me. Each drink has an individual glass w h h  carved ice. H  carved!   really feel like  're walking in  an illic  speakeasy when   ring   door ll       led up a long stairs   a a big opulent Art Deco room. A bow tie would not go am s.

I   l erally walked by th  place a hundred times   never noticed  . No sign, no advert ements; even   webpage offers next   no information about  .   manages   really retain   air of  ing a l tle secret, open   a select few, spread by word of mouth. Such a good marketing style for th  type of place.

My only letdown     price, w h nearly all drinks coming in over  euro. I'd only go   odd time so  's not  o bad on   wallet   for   qual y drinks   service     ,  's well worth   money."

But   o r side of me wants th  place   stay in business, so I'm b ing   bullet   leaving a review.

VCC makes me feel as though I've  en transported back in time   dropped off in   /s, at a place that's a mix  tween my great gr mo r's living room   what I imagine Jazz Clubs in   s looked like.   doesn't look like much from   outside, in fact,  've probably walked past   plenty of times. Located on a side street in Temple Bar,  re's a black, unsuspecting door         ring a  ll     let in. I always feel like some sort of Undercover Agent when I come here.

Plenty of o rs   raved about   inside,   yeah,  's awesome.  's small   intimate    's perfect for a date or a ""soph ticated"" girl's night out. As   name suggests,  y do Cocktails,   oh Boy do  y do  m well! Now I will say that  y   a tad b  pricey, but  's absolutely worth  .  ir Cocktail menu   unique   versatile     defin ely won't find a ""Sex on    ach"" or ""Woo woo"" on here   I think   would   an insult    ir Bartenders if   tried   order one (please don't. Seriously. If   come   a place like th    order a Sex on    ach,   should not   in here in   first place.)

 y   do food,   while I can't speak for  ir Dinner, I can say that  ir Brunch   amazing    's  come my # place     Brunch on a weekend.   menu   qu e lim ed, but everything on here   delicious. If  're here for   first time,     Tasting Board. € will     a not so small tasting selection of Eggs  nnie, Colcannon Cake   French  ast all on one (wooden) plate.   Colcannon Cake   by far my most favor e  em on  ir Brunch menu; a great tw t on   trad ional Colcannon    's served w h ham   a fried egg on  p. YUM!

If     room for a dessert after,     pan baked Brownie w h fresh Rasp rries   P tacchio Ice cream   th  can easily   sh d  tween two people (or three!) as  's qu e heavy (but oh so good!).

So whe r  're up for an expertly mixed Cocktail or want   feed  r appet e   if   fancy a different setting from   usual no y Dublin Bars, give VCC a try!"

Cocktails were well crafted     chocolate brownie dessert was worth every calorie. One point deducted for service,   bartenders need wa staff that matches  ir tier."

Except   say that   just     give in     pretentiousness  fore going. Don't go if  're in   mood   scoff at   over priced, contrived nature of   all. Do go if   can give  rself over     k sch     fabulous. Cocktails   expensive,   very slow   arrive, but worth   when  y do.  ir ice   more icy than any o r ice I've ever seen!"

First impressions were great   very classy   greeted by a hostess who  ok welcomed us   inv ed us   a table. Almost immediately our server came along   again welcomed us   gave us both our drinks   food menus. She left us   settle   checked back in again. I needed   borrow some reading glasses   our server kindly borrowed a pair from '  fox' on    p floor. Seemingly  re were left  hind a couple of weeks ago     fox has  en wearing since. But I was oh so happy.   re was a group of about  ladies or so whom we spoke     seemingly   can make group bookings for  hours   very generous I think. Dotted around were groups of 's   's. Seems we all dressed up so I'd recommend   do likew e   no jeans please! Atmosphere   very like Speakeasy clubs I    en   in New York so well done     folks here for creating a new br  for Dublin. Back     cocktails   a decent range   I would imagine something for everyone. My friend tried   Pineapple Fizz   I had   Dirty Wizard, both were delicious but I thought on   small size for almost $ each.  Our drinks were brought in an appropriate time   nice presentation. Next round we opted for spir s   glad   see that   mixers were not   usual br    well priced spir s I thought   really liked our drinking glasses.    appe d   us that most people were drinking cocktails.

Our server inv ed us     a look around  fore we left so we did. Downstairs  re was a private party in full swing.   has   own's bar   lots style of seating   a different vi    where we were s ting so next time I would like   try downstairs.

Upstairs  re   what appears       smoking  a (I could   wrong on th  one since I didn't smell smoke but  y always say    st fun   in   smoking  a)     was very busy   has  s own bar.

Overall I was very impressed   like ano r yelper says  s a great location for a special occasion .... may  a date .... but even for a couple of gals as was in my case. A fabpre or post dinner drinks location. I underst   y   a late night licence so perhaps  re   lots of fun     had late in    night.
Since  s on   busy side of Chr tmas I would recommend making a reservation   however from my call yesterday    ir webs e, half   club   held for reservations     o r half for walk ins.

So a special thanks   wonderful   accommodating staff   well trained on   drinks side of things   cus mer experience.     doorman was A."

Staff put   in  r place (l erally   metaphorically)     can feel  m start   s pwatch when   s  down (     a certin time slot   heaven forefend   want   stay  minutes later). Staff   incredibly inflexible on seating   desp e a reservation we were sat downstairs in a charmless downstairs bar  a, so close     couple next   us (romantic date?) that we no doubt (girlie catch up) ruined any hope of c less wh pers for  m (we'd   heard  m). Food was middling, nothing awful, chewy steaks   late chips, noting great     night we arrive  y had NO COFFEE, none at all....coffee machine was broken  not really excusable in a restaurant. As we left, having  en presented w h a bill we hadn't asked for   effectively  en  ld   feck off, we saw a couple arrive   ask   change seats (in   now empty downstairs p )    y were greeted w h a sharp ""th     r seat"" response.

Look for   wh e letters ""VCC"" on an o rw e unmarked door.   ambiance   delightful,   service pleasant,     drinks   die for   I particularly recommend   drink called ""Trouble   Strife""; desp e my resolution   try as many different drinks as I could safely consume, I ended up ordering that one twice. I let our server, Annmarie, know how much I liked  ,     turns out she was   one who originally compounded  s recipe (   , as far as I remem r, made of gin, cloves,   SORCERY.) Annmarie was so nice,     whole experience was extremely pleasant   we didn't even feel out of place in our gross backpacking clo s, desp e   numerous dressed up patrons, we just felt  tally welcome   fantastic. Our plan     return in five years time when we   saved up some money for a) plane tickets, b) many, many (adm tedly expensive, but worth  ) drinks   c) amazing s wear worthy of th  elegant establ hment."

After having a bad experience in ano r cocktail bar in  wn, we left  re   asked a taxi driver   take us   a good cocktail bar which wasn't full of hipsters.

(Seemingly       ring a door ll when  re   no doorman  re.) We walked up a narrow set of stairs   were greeted by a smiling, very friendly lady who asked if we had made a reservation. When we said no    ld her we'd never  en here  fore she said   was no problem, she didn't   any tables at   moment but  re were two bar s ols downstairs available or some st ing room on   Roof Bar.

Our s ols were pulled out for us   she introduced us   our wa ress, Amy I think, who brought us over   menus. We had  cocktails each, (I can't remem r   names) all   while chatting     bartender who was really friendly answering every question we asked about   venue   drinks which I'm sure he must do several times a night.   drinks arrived really quickly all   while  ing made right in front of us so we really got   see   effort   art that went in  each drink.  We paid up our bill     hostess gave us a business card on   way out for if we would like   book in at anytime. All in all a really special, relaxing night after a d astrous  ginning. I can't wa    return w h a booking next time!"
